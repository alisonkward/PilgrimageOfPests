  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.3znysh7" id="h.3znysh7"></a>Chapter 1: Encounters</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Somewhere across the expanse of a cool awakening sky, a low monotonous buzz wound its weary way
  through the misty woodlands that stood at the edge of a land called Meadowfield. &nbsp;The buzzing sound wandered through the
  dwindling shadows of the trees. &nbsp;The gloom of suntime&#39;s end was fading. &nbsp;Streaks of color flickered, and finally
  poured down from the distant hills.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The breaking light revealed the wings of a single worker honeybee. &nbsp;She buzzed through the
  trees, spiraling in and out of branches, stopping only to admire her reflection in pools of dew gathered in the crimson leaves.
  &nbsp;Now and then, a leaf would fall and the bee would follow it toward the ground in a casual game of chase. &nbsp;Then she
  would fly up, rising high, buzzing away from the hive she left in the darkness of the forest.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Meanwhile, down on the ground, tucked beneath a damp decaying leaf, lay Cockroach. &nbsp;He was
  taking a well-deserved nap. &nbsp;He had foraged all suntime&#39;s end, looking for scribble skin scraps and other tasty delights
  to add to his fermenting, germ-infested pile of stinking filth. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He was proud of his pile. &nbsp;It grew bigger and better with every foraging trip. &nbsp;There
  was almost always some new, filthy item to add. &nbsp;However, his last trip had not been successful. &nbsp;Not one morsel of
  mold did he find; therefore, he was in a particularly ugly mood. &nbsp;That annoying buzzing sound in the trees wasn&rsquo;t
  helping either.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He tried to ignore it, but the more he tried, the louder it became. &nbsp;And the louder it
  became, the madder Cockroach grew. &nbsp;Finally, when he decided he could stand it no longer, he exploded in a rage.
  &nbsp;&quot;You yellow banded busybody!&quot; he shouted as he flung back his leaf-cover. &nbsp;&quot;I suppose you have nothing
  better to do than buzz over me. &nbsp;And right at suntime too! &nbsp;Do you hear me?&rdquo; he screamed, shaking his clenched
  tarsal in the air. &ldquo;Do you hear me?&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200, as she was known by her hive, heard Cockroach&#39;s foul ravings, and she tried to
  ignore him. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">No dignified member of the Queen&#39;s hive would waste time on a pest of such little
  worth as Cockroach</span><span class="c4">, she thought to herself. &nbsp;It was typical Cockroach behavior. &nbsp;She had heard
  it all before. &nbsp;This time, however, Cockroach seemed to be taking it a little too far. Worker 1200&rsquo;s patience was
  wearing thin.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Then it happened. &nbsp;Cockroach launched the ultimate insult. &nbsp;It hit Worker 1200 like the
  kick of a katydid.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&quot;Get out of here you</span> <span class="c2">cicada killing wasp!&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">One of Cockroach&#39;s neighbors, in fact it was his only neighbor, was the slippery-skinned
  Silverfish. &nbsp;Silverfish lived just a cricket leap away in a wonderful, silvery cylinder, which appeared one suntime while
  Cockroach was off on a long foraging trip. &nbsp;All the commotion startled her from her sleep. &nbsp;She tumbled out of her
  cylinder, rolled across the mossy ground and landed face first in a pool of dew. &nbsp;The first thing Silverfish saw when she
  opened her tiny eyes was Cockroach. &nbsp;Never had she seen Cockroach so angry. &nbsp;He was stomping around like a crazy
  katydid, spinning about in tight, angry circles and using the foulest of language. &nbsp;It was enough to wake the dead
  ancestors.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&quot;What in the name of Leaping Long-Horns is going on?&quot; demanded Silverfish, shaking the
  dew from her body.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She scurried to the top of a mossy rock to gain a better view. &nbsp;She had just spotted the
  worker bee circling above her when she heard Cockroach&rsquo;s terrible insult. &nbsp;It made her antennae curl.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&quot;Cicada killing wasp,&quot; she gasped under her breath. &nbsp;&quot;Now that&#39;s one I
  haven&#39;t heard before.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 was infuriated. &nbsp;She flew high in the air, dipped her wings and came barreling
  down in a fury. &nbsp;She sliced through the trees like a Beak Beast. &nbsp;Swirling leaves sucked in behind her. &nbsp;She
  smacked into Cockroach&#39;s shell as hard as she could. &nbsp;Cockroach never knew what hit him. &nbsp;He went tumbling end over
  end across the ground until he landed face first in a cold puddle of water. &nbsp;Groaning and moaning, he wobbled to his feet.
  &nbsp;Worker 1200 climbed high for another aerial assault. &nbsp;This time, Cockroach ducked. &nbsp;He felt every bristle on his
  back bend with the buzz-sawing blitz of the dive-bombing bee.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">All the while, Silverfish was cheering with delight from her front row seat on the mossy rock.
  &nbsp;This was certainly entertainment worth waking up for. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on Cockroach! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not going to take
  that, are you?&rdquo; she shrieked. &nbsp;Then she threw back her head and shouted, &ldquo;Do it again little bee. &nbsp;He can
  take it! &nbsp;His hide&rsquo;s as tough as a beetle&#39;s back! &nbsp;Swat him again! &nbsp;Oh, how much fun!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach ran for cover. &nbsp;He dashed toward the silvery cylinder. &nbsp;Silverfish knew what
  Cockroach was up to. &nbsp;Before Cockroach could reach her home, she leaped from the mossy rock and threw herself across the
  entrance to her cylinder.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Not on your life, Cockroach!&rdquo; she snarled. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not entering my
  home under any condition! &nbsp;I don&#39;t allow anyone in here, especially you!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Silverfish, let me by. &nbsp;I&#39;ve never seen your home. &nbsp;You&#39;ve talked so much
  about it,&rdquo; Cockroach wheedled.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Impossible! &nbsp;No admittance. &nbsp;Get away from my door or I&#39;ll have you hauled
  off by a herd of army ants.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Once again, from out of the trees, came the dive-bombing bee. &nbsp;Cockroach dove to the ground
  as Worker 1200 swooped by. &nbsp;Cockroach panicked. &nbsp;He started digging wildly under Silverfish&#39;s cylinder.
  &nbsp;Sprays of earth flew in every direction.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Get out of here! Stop it, Cockroach! What are you doing? &nbsp;You are making a terrible
  mess.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach continued digging.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach, there&#39;s a big digger wasp that lives under there and I hope he stings you
  good,&rdquo; said Silverfish, knowing full well that there wasn&#39;t.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach could only think of the angry bee, buzzing furiously overhead.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach,</span> <span class="c3">just last suntime&rsquo;s end I saw an eight-legged
  hairy Web-Spinner crawl under my home right where you are digging,&rdquo; said Silverfish knowing full well that she
  hadn&#39;t.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach just wanted to get the last of his body covered before the bee returned.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Under her breath Silverfish said, &ldquo;Maybe there is something under there I don&#39;t want you
  to see,&rdquo; and she crawled up close to Cockroach to peer into the ever-widening tunnel.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly Cockroach lurched backwards. &nbsp;There was something stuck on his back leg. &nbsp;He
  shook it in the air as he pulled his body out of the burrow.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Scribble skin. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Sticky</span> <span class="c4">scribble skin!
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Sweet</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;sticky scribble skin!&rdquo; exclaimed Cockroach as he freed
  himself from the crumpled up red sheet. &nbsp;&ldquo;What is</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;this</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;doing
  here? &nbsp;This is</span> <span class="c2">mine</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh nonsense, Cockroach. &nbsp;That&#39;s probably been there...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You took this from me!&rdquo; interrupted Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;You were hiding it from
  me. Buried, right here!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now how do you know that belongs to you? &nbsp; It could...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You even chewed part of it off. &nbsp;See here. &nbsp;I spent three suntimes learning the
  scribble shapes and you&#39;ve chewed two of them off!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach, I think you&rsquo;re confused. &nbsp;Why, I&#39;ve never
  even...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I remember the first one was shaped like a beetle grub... all curled up. &nbsp;Just like
  this.&rdquo; Cockroach scratched out a shape in the dirt that looked like: &nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c9">C</span><span class=
  "c4">. &nbsp;&ldquo;The last one looked like a branch. &nbsp;Just like this.&rdquo; &nbsp;And he scratched out a shape that
  looked like: &nbsp;</span><span class="c9 c6">Y</span><span class="c4">.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only three left now,&rdquo; Cockroach said. &nbsp;He pointed to the three
  shapes on the red scribble skin spread on the ground. &nbsp;They looked like this: &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c9 c6">A</span><span class="c4">...</span> <span class="c9 c6">N</span><span class="c4">...</span> <span class=
  "c9 c6">D</span><span class="c4">.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach, please. &nbsp;Such things can be resolved, humm... peacefully. &nbsp;Quite
  peacefully, I am sure.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach&#39;s wings began to rattle in anger and his antennae whirled and twirled. &nbsp;His
  beady eyes bulged out of his head. &nbsp;He looked angry enough to rip poor Silverfish to smithereens. &nbsp;But he just spun
  about in tight angry circles, stamping and stomping from one side to another. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thief! &nbsp;That&#39;s it!
  &nbsp;You&#39;re a thief! &nbsp;I live next to a thief! &nbsp;A scaly scoundrel. &nbsp;A scribble skinning
  thief!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh pleeeease, Cockroach. &nbsp;Don&#39;t act so righteous,&rdquo; sighed Silverfish,
  rolling her tiny eyes. &ldquo;I can remember more than one act of burglary you pulled on me! &nbsp;Like the time you were caught
  peeling the scribble skin off my silvery cylinder.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh! &nbsp;So you&#39;re going to bring that up again? &nbsp;A piece so small it
  couldn&#39;t have fed a Wood Louse?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, and the only reason you didn&#39;t take more is because I heard you scratching and
  scraping on the cylinder.</span> <span class="c3">You ran off like a coward and you have yet to admit your
  guilt!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;And I won&#39;t. &nbsp;And I wonder how many more of my tidbits you have hidden
  under that cylinder of yours!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">That</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;you will never know.
  &nbsp;Besides, I&#39;m sure you have just as many of</span> <span class="c2">my</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;things in</span>
  <span class="c2">your</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;stink pile.&rdquo; She smiled smugly.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">On and on the bickering continued. &nbsp;Brutal and bitter. &nbsp;Vile and venomous. &nbsp;Loud
  and lengthy.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The sounds of their shouts carried into the trees, to where Worker 1200 sat and watched the
  contest unfolding below her. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">How vulgar. &nbsp;How uncivilized they act</span><span class="c4">,
  thought Worker 1200. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they&#39;ve forgotten all about me.
  &nbsp;Such short attention spans.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 looked down at her throbbing back leg. &nbsp;It was soaking in an icy pool of water
  held in the cupped edges of a leaf. &nbsp;Grimacing with pain, the bee leaned back on the branch and raised her injured leg to
  inspect the damage. &nbsp;The edge of the silvery cylinder had left a nasty red mark across her leg. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Lousy luck</span><span class="c4">, thought Worker 1200. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">I guess I smacked it good. &nbsp;Must
  have happened on that last swoop. &nbsp;Just caught it on the up-turn. &nbsp;If only I had acted with more dignity, I would never
  have done something so foolish. &nbsp;I shouldn&rsquo;t let such a primitive creature... dare I say it... bug me.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Gently, the injured bee lowered her leg back into the icy bath. &nbsp;She closed her eyes and
  started thinking. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Duties! &nbsp;So many duties yet to complete. &nbsp;How will I ever finish
  them?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;She was terribly worried. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">How can I do anything with an injured
  leg?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; She had so much work to do before The Great Cold arrived, and with the coming of the Great
  Cicada, there would be even more work. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Ahhh yes. &nbsp;The Great Cicada,</span> <span class=
  "c4">she thought.</span> <span class="c2">What an event that will be!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She remembered the Queen calling all the workers and drones together for the big announcement.
  &nbsp;&#39;A Grand Ball for all the bug-fellows of Meadowfield,&rsquo; she had said. &nbsp;&lsquo;A gala. &nbsp;An event grander
  than anything Meadowfield has ever seen. &nbsp;All Meadowfield will honor the emergence of the Great Cicada, the oldest and
  wisest bug-fellow in the land. &nbsp;He&#39;ll emerge from his underground tomb after seventeen Great Colds and seventeen</span>
  <span class="c3">Warming Times</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and he will reign over all of Meadowfield. &nbsp;Never will the
  pollen run so sweet and the trees grow so green.&#39;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, it will be something to behold,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;thought Worker 1200.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">But the work! &nbsp;All the endless suntimes of preparation! &nbsp;Simple pollen and nectar
  collections will seem like nothing compared to this. &nbsp;There will be entertainment to organize, food to prepare, and the
  Queen will probably keep me working right through all the festivities!</span> <span class="c4">Worker 1200 sighed.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Ohhhhh,&rdquo; groaned the bee, wrapping a wing over</span> <span class="c3">her</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;eyes.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;It hurts just to think about it.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">While the quarreling continued below,</span> <span class="c3">she remained stretched out on the
  limb; a leg numb with pain and a mountain of r</span><span class="c4">esponsibility looming over her head. &nbsp;For the moment,
  all she could do was moan.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ohh... ohhh... Oooww... waa!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The bee dozed off for just a second, but she suddenly sat up, wide-eyed with a start. &nbsp;She
  had heard a voice--a very deep, foreboding sound. &nbsp;She wasn&#39;t sure what it said, if anything. &nbsp;She glanced about
  frantically, but could see nothing. &nbsp;Again, the voice repeated.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hummmm. Oh my, yes. &nbsp;My brothers and sisters would love to have your body crunching
  between their jaws. &nbsp;A delightful meal, little worker bee.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.2et92p0" id="h.2et92p0"></a>Chapter 2: Mantis</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;Worker 1200 knew the voices of her enemies. &nbsp;She had to if she intended to live to the
  next meadow flowering. &nbsp;She knew the hissing voice of dragonfly, but the voice she heard was nothing like his. &nbsp;Nor was
  it the sickening sound of the horrid robber fly, who patrolled the open meadow. &nbsp;It was unlikely he would venture this deep
  into the woods. &nbsp;Could it be the voice of the bully wasps? &nbsp;No, this voice didn&rsquo;t make the grating sound of
  grinding wasp jaws. &nbsp;Fluffy Beak Beasts, like those she saw one suntime ripping an unfortunate band of grasshoppers apart,
  crossed her mind. &nbsp;They could be louder than a chorus of katydids and meaner than a hornet&rsquo;s nest. &nbsp;She could
  still hear their cackling. &nbsp;But this wasn&rsquo;t</span> <span class="c3">a</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;any of
  those.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">So whose voice was it? &nbsp;Worker 1200 strained the thousand lenses of her eyes hoping to see
  movement in the leaves. &nbsp;She studied every part of the branch she sat upon.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Thou dost not see me, dost thou?&rdquo; the deep voice finally spoke again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 spun around in confusion.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I really never thought to be blessed at this hide and seek game. &nbsp;My brothers and
  sisters were always far better than me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">This intruder is not going to get the best of me,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;thought Worker
  1200. &nbsp;She felt the little stinger at the base of her abdomen tingle. &nbsp;She would use it if she needed to.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Tell me, dost thou really not see me?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; shouted the frustrated bee. &ldquo;But come out of your hiding
  place and I&rsquo;ll poke you with my stinger a good one.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But I am not hiding. &nbsp;I am right in front of you. &nbsp;And please do not be upset.
  &nbsp;I was merely testing my hide and seek techniques on thee.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; said Worker 1200 suspiciously. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
  anything in front of me but leaves and branches.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Lo, just watch. Thou art looking right at me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Something did begin to move in front of Worker 1200. &nbsp;A green branch began to bend toward the
  bee; a green branch that began to look more and more like a gigantic leg mechanically unfolding. &nbsp;Then she saw the movement
  of a great triangular head high up in another branch. &nbsp;The honeybee gasped when she realized the head was part of the
  branch... or was the branch part of the head?</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ohhh. &nbsp;By the Queen&rsquo;s throne. &nbsp;What am I seeing?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The frightened bee felt paralyzed. &nbsp;She was looking into the bulbous eyes of the most
  terrifying creature she could imagine. &nbsp;A great, green creature of enormous dimensions with an upper body held high above a
  flattened lower body, covered by a pair of leaf-like wings. Folded together in front of the head, a pair of spiny-tipped arms
  bent downward, then upward and then downward again, in three hinged sections. &nbsp;The powerful body swayed back and forth on
  four stalking legs; its shiny, triangular head was cocked to one side. &nbsp;The jaws were locked in a menacing grin. &nbsp;They
  began moving in a slow grinding stroke when the creature spoke again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thou must see me now, yes? &nbsp;I had you
  quite tricked for a while, did I not? &nbsp;So what dost thou think? &nbsp;How did I do?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 could barely speak. &nbsp;She was still numb with fright. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wha... What are
  you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Why, thou hast never seen my kind before?&rdquo; answered the creature. &nbsp;It cocked its
  head to the side and shifted its body in the same direction.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;No, I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve seen one of</span> <span class=
  "c2">you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;at any time.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, now thou hast. &nbsp;But I really wish thou would have tried a little harder to find
  me.&rdquo; &nbsp;The creature hesitated as if it was waiting for Worker 1200 to comment. &nbsp;But, as the bee was still too
  scared to speak, the creature continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am Mantis. &nbsp;Pleased to meet thee.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Mantis?&rdquo; questioned the honeybee. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pra... Pra... Praying
  Mantis?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ahh. &nbsp;So thou</span> <span class="c2">hast</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;seen one of me
  after all.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Only heard,&rdquo; the bee gulped. &nbsp;&ldquo;Only heard of... of...
  pra... aaying ma... ma... mantises.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh. &nbsp;Well I hopest what thou hast heard has all been good. And we prefer the term
  mantids.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, o-of-of course,&rdquo; she stuttered. &ldquo;No. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, what I
  have heard...&rdquo; Worker 1200 hesitated. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, it hasn&rsquo;t been good. &nbsp;Actually... bad... quite
  bad.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh. &nbsp;So thou hast heard all the horror stories too. &nbsp;I just cannot seem to get
  away from them. &nbsp;A bad reputation doth precede me wherever I go.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, you do have some quite frightening... habits. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you? &nbsp;I
  mean...ugh.&rdquo; &nbsp;Worker 1200&rsquo;s stomach suddenly felt sick. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&#39;t... don&rsquo;t you</span>
  <span class="c2">eat</span> <span class="c4">bug fellows?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You mean, like thou?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well... now... now,&rdquo; stammered the nervous bee. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not me, specifically,
  you understand.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You know, actually there</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;something I likest much about</span> <span class="c2">bees</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo;
  thought Mantis cocking his head again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh no,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;worried Worker 1200 to herself. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Here it comes.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; The bee shut her eyes and buried her head.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Honey.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Worker 1200.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Honey. &nbsp;I like honey,&rdquo; said Mantis matter-of-factly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I have
  tried eating bees a time or two. &nbsp;The crunch</span> <span class="c3">doth turn</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;my stomach.
  &nbsp;But that sweet taste on the bee--the nectar I thinkest--that was quite delicious. &nbsp;And when I found out how good honey
  is... Well, who needeth bugs. &nbsp;Just give me honey.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; &nbsp;Worker 1200 chuckled in disbelief. &nbsp;&ldquo;You
  don&rsquo;t like the taste of bugs? &nbsp;You, one of the legendary, monstrous praying mantids that devour bees and bugs,
  but</span> <span class="c2">you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;don&rsquo;t like them? &nbsp;Or is this a joke? &nbsp;A sick, awful
  joke?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I feel guilty because I have eaten bugs, and</span> <span class="c2">now</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;thou art making me feel guilty because I abstain.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Please. Please don&rsquo;t take me wrong. &nbsp;I mean it&rsquo;s fine
  you don&rsquo;t eat bugs. &nbsp;I mean... you</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;must</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;know... that&rsquo;s
  fine with me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose. &nbsp;But my brothers and sisters would thinkest not. &nbsp;Lo, they enjoy
  sinking their jaws into a good grasshopper leg, or pulling out bee wings with their teeth. &nbsp;They enjoy it immensely.
  &nbsp;Even more than playing hide and seek.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And your brothers and sisters... would... would they be nearby?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, I suppose they are somewhere around, but not nearby. &nbsp;Sadly, we left each other
  some time ago. &nbsp;Most of them liveth on the other side of the forest. Some dwelleth beyond the meadow and over the
  hills.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You mean the Smoking Hills?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose. &nbsp;If that is what you call them,&rdquo; said Mantis. &nbsp;&ldquo;At
  any rate, I knowest no family that dwelleth here in Meadowfield.&rdquo; &nbsp;Mantis hesitated. &nbsp;&ldquo;That is what thou
  hast proclaimed this place to be?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, Meadowfield,&rdquo; the bee quickly responded. &nbsp;&ldquo;And so you have no sisters
  or wing-picking brothers about? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t mind saying... I&rsquo;m relieved to hear that.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I miss them greatly,&rdquo; said Mantis sorrowfully.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh yes. &nbsp;Yes, I am sure you do. &nbsp;I... I didn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m
  glad</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t with them,&rdquo; Worker 1200 sensed that she may
  have just insulted the mantis.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But we had differences,&rdquo; continued Mantis. &nbsp;&ldquo;Disagreements on how to
  liveth a life. &nbsp;We had different things we felt we should do.&rdquo; &nbsp;Mantis sighed deeply and turned back to the
  worker honeybee. &nbsp;&ldquo;Like fix</span> <span class="c3">thy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;leg for one thing.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Thine</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;anger can only turn against thee. &nbsp;Thou must learnest to
  turn thy other cheek. &nbsp;He who casts stones renders harm to no one but himself. &nbsp;Now, let us fix that
  leg.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 sat in utter disbelief. &nbsp;She had fully expected to become a meal for this great,
  green gargoyle but now, Mantis was actually helping her.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Mantis lifted up one of his wings. &nbsp;&ldquo;I always keepest a little bee&rsquo;s wax tucked
  under here with a dab of honey on it. &nbsp;I like keeping some close for those honey urges. &nbsp;I told you I liketh honey.
  &nbsp;A wax pack around thy leg should keep it straight, and so it will healeth just fine.&rdquo; &nbsp;Mantis folded his wings
  back into place and gently lifted the worker bee into his enormous, spiny forearms. &nbsp;With some apprehension, Worker 1200
  watched Mantis carefully coat the leg with wax. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now this shall not hurt,&rdquo; declared Mantis and he hoisted the
  bee up to his mouth.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What are you doing? &nbsp;You</span> <span class="c2">are</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;going to eat me! &nbsp;You spread me with honeyed wax and now you&rsquo;re going to eat me. &nbsp;Oh my Queen!
  &nbsp;Oh my hive! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll never see either one again!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Please relax, little bee. &nbsp;Lo, it is the only way I can packeth down the wax. &nbsp;As
  thee can see, I&rsquo;ve run out of arms.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">With that, Mantis gripped the bee with his forearms and placed the injured leg between his jaws.
  &nbsp;Ever so gently he applied the necessary pressure to compress the wax firmly around the leg. &nbsp;Then he lowered the bee
  down to the branch.</span></p>

  <p class="c15"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That was not so bad, was it?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c49 c33 c30 c23 c39"><span class="c4 c13">Worker 1200 didn&rsquo;t answer. &nbsp;She had passed out cold.</span></p>

  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.tyjcwt" id="h.tyjcwt"></a>Chapter 3: Loomer Rumors</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4">&nbsp;The first freezing suntime&rsquo;s end came to Meadowfield quite unexpectedly. &nbsp;It
  followed a drizzly suntime that kept most of Meadowfield indoors. &nbsp;It was so dreary, the Waterboatmen races across Meadow
  Pond had to be canceled. &nbsp;It was so miserable, the honeybees stayed boxed up, bickering and complaining, in their cramped
  honeycomb. &nbsp;It was one of those suntimes only a Cockroach could like.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Actually, it wasn&rsquo;t the weather that Cockroach enjoyed. He just seemed to sleep well with
  the gentle drippings on his leafy covers lulling him to sleep.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Drip....</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Drop...</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Dribble-dreep,&rdquo; the drips seemed to say.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Dropping into deeper sleep.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Pitter...</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Patter...</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Pitter-Pat...</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Deepest sleep is where it&rsquo;s at.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach was fast asleep when the freeze started moving in. &nbsp;He never knew Meadowfield could
  get so cold. &nbsp; Had he known, he would have slept on top of his stink pile. &nbsp;The heat of the rotting compost could have
  warmed his belly up there. &nbsp;But, as luck would have it, he had decided to sleep on the bare ground.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The rain stopped by suntime&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;The gray skies slid away and layers of clear, cold
  air rolled in. &nbsp;Icesticks formed on the branches. &nbsp;The ground grew hard and frosty.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">With a shiver Cockroach woke, but he couldn&rsquo;t move. &nbsp;He was frozen to the ground.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; chattered Cockroach. &nbsp;He pulled and tugged until his legs came loose from the ice. &nbsp;He
  pushed his belly off the frozen earth. &nbsp;&ldquo;Brrrr. &nbsp;That could have been a terrible mess. &nbsp;I could have been
  frozen!&rdquo; exclaimed Cockroach. &nbsp;He started to hurry off, but his head jerked backwards and he hit the ice with a body
  slam. &nbsp;He was still stuck. &nbsp;One of his antennae was frozen deep in the ice. &nbsp;Cockroach began pulling wildly, first
  one way and then another. &nbsp;He spun and twisted around his tethered antenna. &nbsp;He slipped over on his back and began
  sliding about in circles. &nbsp;His six legs thrashed about in every direction as he spun helplessly on the ice. &nbsp;He rolled
  to his belly, caught his breath and began racing around in a panic again, going nowhere and gaining nothing. &nbsp;He was in a
  dilemma indeed.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;If you yank much harder you&rsquo;re going to rip that thing right out of your head.&rdquo;
  &nbsp;It was Silverfish, just heading off for her suntime&rsquo;s end forage.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach tried to roll his head around to look at Silverfish, but Silverfish was on the same side
  as the attached antennae and Cockroach couldn&rsquo;t twist his head in that direction.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Crawling crickets! &nbsp;I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re in a sorry situation. &nbsp;But no need
  to worry,</span> <span class="c3">Cockroach. &nbsp;That</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;ice ought to thaw out in a suntime or
  two.&rdquo; &nbsp; And Silverfish crawled up beside Cockroach and whispered, &ldquo;That is... unless it never warms up in
  time.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make fun of me! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to do. &nbsp;Get me
  out of here Silverfish! &nbsp;Get me out of here right now!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now Cockroach, you could at least say</span> <span class="c2">please</span><span class=
  "c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach pulled hard at the antennae in anger. &nbsp;&ldquo;Silverfish, you&rsquo;re making me
  mad! &nbsp;You just get me loose!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish walked to the other side of Cockroach. &nbsp;She couldn&rsquo;t help but giggle when
  she looked into Cockroach&rsquo;s miserable face. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, this could take some doing,&rdquo; said Silverfish,
  assessing the situation. &nbsp;She inspected the antenna buried in the ice and gave it a sharp tug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; shrieked Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;My dear Cockroach,&rdquo; started Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;You know my services are not
  free. &nbsp;I mean, you can&rsquo;t expect me to help you out for</span> <span class="c2">nothing</span><span class=
  "c4">!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, let&rsquo;s see</span><span class="c4">, thought Silverfish. &nbsp;She walked around to the
  side where Cockroach couldn&rsquo;t see her and thought for a very long time. &nbsp;&ldquo;Dinner,&rdquo; she said at last.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I want you to fix me a magnificent dinner. &nbsp;And I want you to bring out the best of your tasty tidbits.
  &nbsp;The ones you&rsquo;ve probably been saving forever. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll bring a couple of glowworms and we&rsquo;ll make it
  quite fancy. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll set ourselves up on the Old Stump and I&rsquo;ll stuff myself silly.&rdquo; Silverfish crawled
  around in front of Cockroach and pressed her face right into Cockroach&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;And then... then we&rsquo;ll
  talk,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Talk?&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach didn&rsquo;t like company, he didn&rsquo;t like sharing food
  and he especially didn&rsquo;t like conversation. &nbsp;&ldquo;Talk? &nbsp;Talk about what? &nbsp; What do</span> <span class=
  "c2">we</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;have to talk about?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish smiled to herself. &nbsp;Ever so slowly, she inched her way closer to Cockroach.
  &nbsp;Then, getting right beside Cockroach&rsquo;s ear, she whispered, &ldquo;Loomers.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then again, slowly stretching
  out the middle vowels, she repeated, &ldquo;Looooooooomers. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll talk, and you can tell me all you know about the
  Loooooooomers.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Loomers? &nbsp;What do I know about Loomers?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Plenty.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I know nothing about them. &nbsp;Never even heard of them.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Bah! &nbsp;Now I know you&rsquo;re lying.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, maybe I&rsquo;ve heard of them. &nbsp;I suppose everyone has heard the rumors.
  &nbsp;Loomer Rumors. &nbsp;But I have nothing to add to them.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, then I&rsquo;ll see you when you thaw! &nbsp;That is, if you ever do.&rdquo; And
  Silverfish began to walk away.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach leaped up. &nbsp;His frozen antenna jerked him and he fell
  flat on his back. &nbsp;&ldquo;All right. &nbsp;All right,&rdquo; he said thrashing his legs in the air. &nbsp;&ldquo;Dinner at
  Old Stump, and we&rsquo;ll talk. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll talk about the Loomers. &nbsp;Now get me out of here. &nbsp;Get me out of here
  right now!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Five suntimes had passed since Silverfish freed Cockroach. &nbsp;It had been a most difficult
  task&mdash;and dangerous too. &nbsp;Silverfish tricked a Fluffy Beak Beast into driving her beak through the ice, breaking
  Cockroach free. &nbsp;She assured Cockroach the plan would work, although Cockroach never believed her. &nbsp;It had taken all
  suntime&rsquo;s end for the Beak Beast to wake and poor Cockroach nearly froze to death. &nbsp;The whole incident was terrifying
  and Cockroach was certain he would suffer fright dreams forever. &nbsp;At any rate, the frozen air had vanished as quickly as it
  had arrived, and it was now time for Cockroach to pay his debt to Silverfish.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The dinner convened as planned on the Old Stump, several cricket leaps from the back of
  Cockroach&rsquo;s stink pile. &nbsp;It was a lovely suntime&rsquo;s end with a slight crisp breeze. &nbsp;Silverfish arrived just
  before dark, and positioned herself on a slab of shelf fungus jutting out from the edge of the stump. &nbsp;Cockroach was busy
  digging through his stink pile. &nbsp;He was selecting the cuisine very carefully. &nbsp;He was looking for tidbits that may be
  acceptable to Silverfish, without pulling out his finest gourmet treasures.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re bringing out your best, Cockroach,&rdquo; Silverfish sang
  out.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;d rather die first</span><span class="c4">, thought Cockroach to himself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach struggled to haul the tidbits from the stink pile. &nbsp;He wrestled them up the side of
  the Old Stump and dumped them down in front of Silverfish. &nbsp;Silverfish caught a red berry rolling from the pile. &nbsp;She
  leaned forward to inspect the food. &nbsp;&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; she uttered. &nbsp;Then, to get a better look, she placed two
  glowworms in front of the pile and began to sift through it. &nbsp;Cockroach sat quietly to the side just beyond the light of the
  glowworms.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Glowworms, what do you think?&rdquo; asked Silverfish knowing that glowworms don&rsquo;t
  talk. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Let&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;see. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s some common leaf
  mold. &nbsp;Some red berries. &nbsp;I just had red berries last suntime. &nbsp;A little piece of dry scribble skin.&rdquo;
  &nbsp;Silverfish sat back. &nbsp;&ldquo;Honestly Cockroach. &nbsp;Do you</span> <span class="c2">really</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;think I believe these are your</span> <span class="c2">best</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;tidbits?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, the others are way down in the stinking filth pile and too much trouble to
  reach,&rdquo; snapped Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well now, Cockroach. &nbsp;Maybe the next time you&rsquo;re frozen to the ground,
  you&rsquo;ll be too much trouble too.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach thought about this. &nbsp;He grumbled under his breath. &nbsp;He climbed off the Old
  Stump and turned reluctantly back towards the stink pile.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Take your time Cockroach,&rdquo; called out Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pick out your
  favorites. &nbsp;Get in there and dig deep. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll just wait here and try some of these red berries. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll
  just consider this an appetizer.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It wasn&rsquo;t long before Cockroach returned dragging up the next entree. &nbsp;He flung it
  across the top of the stump. &nbsp;Bits of food flew in all directions. &nbsp;Silverfish found nothing appealing from this second
  effort, with the notable exception of a scrap of Beak Beast egg.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Shall we try it again, Cockroach?&rdquo; inquired Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think you can
  dig a little deeper than this. &nbsp;I mean, exactly</span> <span class="c2">what</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is your life
  worth? &nbsp; Surely more than</span> <span class="c2">this</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo; &nbsp;She held up a shredded piece of
  fruit peel and then flung it into the dark. &nbsp;&ldquo;Go on now, Cockroach. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll just consider this the sample
  before the main course.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">On his way back to the stink pile, Cockroach could hear Silverfish singing and giggling to herself
  as she picked through the food scattered across the Old Stump. &nbsp;Cockroach dug through the stink pile and down to his most
  delicious delicacies. &nbsp;Exotic egg shards. &nbsp;Honey-coated fruit rinds. &nbsp;Sweet sticky scribble skins. &nbsp;And of
  course, his favorite&mdash;the incredibly sweet, pure white, Loomer crystal-cubes. &nbsp;He had two cubes left and he
  didn&rsquo;t part with either one until he was forced to make one more trip. &nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t pleased. &nbsp;In fact, he was
  so angry he hurled the crystal cube and the rest of the food at Silverfish and buried both glowworms in the process.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;My goodness, Cockroach. &nbsp;Your presentation is terribly crude,&rdquo; said Silverfish
  as she dug the glowworms out from under a honey-coated fruit rind. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I must say you&rsquo;ve brought out a
  delicious main course. &nbsp;Hummm... delicious,&rdquo; she said tasting the sweet, white cube. &nbsp;&ldquo;What</span>
  <span class="c2">is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;this wonderfully sweet thing?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Crystal cube,&rdquo; grumbled Cockroach under his breath.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Cockroach. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Crystal cube!&rdquo; &nbsp;Shouted Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class=
  "c2">Loomer</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;crystal cube. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s my very favorite treasure!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh. &nbsp;Well, I can certainly see why. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never tasted anything quite like
  it. &nbsp;Why, I may not even have room for dessert.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish chipped off an edge of the crystal cube. &nbsp;She rolled it in her mouth and let it
  melt down her throat, a little at a time. &nbsp;She continued this way until the cube was gone. &nbsp;It was too much for
  Cockroach to watch. &nbsp;He buried his head in a crack in the stump while Silverfish searched for any pieces of the crystal cube
  she might have dropped. &nbsp;Convinced she ate it all, she leaned back, full with satisfaction.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Are you finished?&rdquo; asked Cockroach with disgust.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Quite delightful. &nbsp;Wouldn&rsquo;t you say, glowworms?&rdquo; &nbsp;The
  glowworms&rsquo; cheeks bulged, so full with berries and fruit rinds they couldn&rsquo;t speak even if they were able
  to.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now Cockroach,&rdquo; said Silverfish as she leaned into the green light of the glowworms.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Speaking of Loomers and crystal cubes and Loomer crystal cubes, we still haven&rsquo;t talked about our subject of
  the evening. &nbsp;And we must, you know. &nbsp;We must talk.&rdquo; Silverfish paused. &ldquo;The subject is even</span>
  <span class="c2">more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;intriguing to me now that I&rsquo;ve tasted the sweetness of the cube.
  &nbsp;We must talk about this. &nbsp;We must talk about that.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">We must talk about the...</span></p>

  <p class="c15"><span class="c4">L-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-mers.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.3dy6vkm" id="h.3dy6vkm"></a>Chapter 4: Sticky Situation</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The frigid cold, which nearly froze Cockroach several suntimes ago, had melted away on a
  smothering wave of heat. &nbsp;Hot breezes scorched the hills. &nbsp;Everything but the blue-green water of Meadow Pond was
  brown. &nbsp;How strange Meadowfield appeared. &nbsp;Instead of being covered in soft cold, Meadowfield was baking in a stagnant
  heat.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">From within the hollow of a dead oak tree, Worker 1200 opened the many lenses of her sleepy eyes.
  &nbsp;All around her, workers were coming awake. &nbsp;All had looks of confusion. &nbsp;They were waking from a sleep that
  should have lasted right through the freezing days of The Great Cold. &nbsp;&ldquo;So why are we waking now?&rdquo; thought
  Worker 1200 to herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was so cold when we settled into our sleep spots, but now it feels terribly hot!
  &nbsp;The Great Cold can&rsquo;t be over already!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 looked ahead toward the main chamber. &nbsp;It was buzzing with activity. &nbsp;An
  alarm was being sounded. &nbsp;Could the hive be under attack? &nbsp;A gang of hooligan wasps? &nbsp;A Giant Honey Paw? &nbsp;Or
  maybe a rival band of bees?</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She decided to move forward to investigate. &nbsp;But what was this? &nbsp;Her wings were sticky
  and her legs were stuck to the honeycomb. &nbsp;All the workers around her were in the same predicament. &nbsp;They were covered
  with honey. &nbsp;Pools of honey. &nbsp;It was dripping down from the top of the hive. &nbsp;The honeycomb was breaking apart.
  &nbsp;Waxy chunks hung from the roof of the hive. &nbsp;Some had already fallen. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">An excited worker from the main chamber flew to the back of the hive. &nbsp;She whirled and danced
  and wagged her tail, then raced off to repeat the performance in another part of the hive. &nbsp;Her message was clear. &nbsp;The
  honeycomb was melting. &nbsp;The late arrival of The Great Cold caught the hive by surprise. &nbsp;It was a fatal error.
  &nbsp;Something had to be done,</span> <span class="c2">if</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;there was still time.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Another worker with another message came into the area. &nbsp;She seemed more composed than the
  first, but just as determined. &nbsp;Her message was short. &nbsp;&ldquo;Go to the entrance immediately!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Dragging ribbons of honey, Worker 1200 and hundreds of other bees charged forward. &nbsp;They
  gathered like a mounting wave at the mouth of the hive. &nbsp;A signal was given and the bees flew from the oak in a swarm of
  thrashing wings. &nbsp;They circled the area once, and then disappeared over the treetops.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Immediately, dozens of young workers lined themselves along the entrance to the hive. &nbsp;Facing
  into the hive, they began courageously beating their wings. &nbsp;Hundreds of wings, beating slowly at first, then steadily
  faster, back and forth, in and out, whipping a current of air into the hive. &nbsp;But the air wasn&rsquo;t cool enough to harden
  the honeycomb. &nbsp;They needed water to cool it; Worker 1200 and the others were heading to Meadow Pond to get it.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Meadow Pond was located in a hollow far below the forest. On one side was a low-lying meadow and
  on the other, a grassy pasture. &nbsp; Far beyond, where suntimes were born, loomed the mysterious Smoking Hills.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Leaping ladybugs!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the workers in the swarm. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look at
  the crowd around the pond! &nbsp;Ants everywhere. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t even see a place to land! &nbsp;What&rsquo;s going on down
  there anyway?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Waterboatman races.&rdquo; said Worker 1200. &nbsp;&ldquo;See the trails coming across the
  pond? &nbsp;Maybe the last of the season. &nbsp;Quite a crowd of ants indeed. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll see if I can negotiate a landing
  spot.&rdquo; &nbsp;And Worker 1200 flew from the swarm and headed down to the pond. &nbsp;She knew the ants would be a problem.
  &nbsp;They always were. &nbsp;They were arrogant, know-it-alls who kept to themselves until a bug-fellow died. &nbsp;Then they
  threw themselves all over the pest.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 landed on the tip of a marsh weed. &nbsp;The ants were all around her.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">This isn&rsquo;t going to be easy,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;thought Worker 1200. &nbsp;Other
  than working themselves to death, the only thing ants enjoyed were the races. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ants! &nbsp;I am a worker bee from a
  great hive in the woods,&rdquo; she began</span> <span class="c3">to address the crowd</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;&ldquo;Our
  hive is in danger of collapse from this unusual heat. &nbsp;Our swarm, directly above you, must reach the edge of the pond to
  collect water to cool our melting honeycombs. &nbsp;I ask... if you could please...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ahh... go stick ya head in wax!&rdquo; an ant in the crowd rudely interrupted.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re blockin&rsquo; my view and I got fifteen Aphid ridin&rsquo; on the Whirligig to win
  it!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The ants pushed and shoved to get a better view. &nbsp;They waved and cheered and sucked honeydew
  from the ends of Aphids. The Waterboatmen races were in full throttle.</span> <span class="c2">&ldquo;In the lead... and
  approaching lily pad passage... &nbsp;it&rsquo;s Whirligig Beetle!&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the middle of
  the pond on old branch dripping with pond scum, a fat, yellow grasshopper announced the race. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">&ldquo;And right behind him is Waterboatman...</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">followed by
  Backswimmer... Waterboatmen 2, Water Bug and Waterstrider bringing up the rear.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 saw the water bugs as they came into view in front of her. &nbsp;Their legs thrashed
  in the water, turning the calm surface into a swirling shower of foam and froth. &nbsp;The ants below her grew more excited than
  ever. &nbsp;The marsh weed she clung to rocked back and forth with the ringing cheers of the crowd.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Please! &nbsp;Listen! &nbsp;We must get to the water! &nbsp;Clear an area for us
  immediately!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A-A-A-A-And... Coming into waterweed straightaway... it&rsquo;s still Whirligig, but
  Waterboatman is closing fast! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s Whirligig leading</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">by four
  cricket leaps... by three... by twooo! &nbsp;Look at Waterboatman! &nbsp;He&rsquo;s making his move on Whirligig... But look out!
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">H-e-e-e-e-e-e-ere comes Backswimmer!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Helplessly, Worker 1200 looked up at the circling bees and thought about her poor hive melting
  away in the forest. &nbsp;&ldquo;If this race doesn&rsquo;t end soon, there&rsquo;ll be no hive to save.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;... It&rsquo;s Whirligig. &nbsp;Waterboatman and... Ba-a-a-a-a-a-ackswimmer coming into the
  final turn through pond scum curve. &nbsp;But Whirligig is spinning out of control!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Mercifully, the racing bugs were closing in on the finish line along the near shore. &nbsp;By this
  time, the yellow grasshopper on the gnarled branch had worked himself into a frenzy. &nbsp;Worker 1200 thought the old fool would
  come out of his skin at any moment.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What... a... race!&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;choked the grasshopper.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s Waterboatman and Backswimmer now stroke for stroke! &nbsp;Whirligig Beetle is out
  of it... It&rsquo;s Waterboatman and Backswimmer coming into the finish. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s going to be close... A-N-N-N-ND...THE
  WINNER IS...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">There was a thunderous roar from the crowd. &nbsp;The racing water bugs drove across the finish
  line as a wave of water crashed behind them. &nbsp;In his excitement, the fat yellow grasshopper fell off the branch and tumbled
  end over end into the pond, gulping down a mouthful of water just as he was about to shout out the winner&rsquo;s name. &nbsp;And
  then, it was over. &nbsp;Aphids were tossed back and forth as lucky winners collected their bets. &nbsp;Crickets and grasshoppers
  faced off in a rollicking chorus of dueling chirps</span> <span class="c3">and leg snapping stridulations.</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Finally, when all the hoopla and commotion settled down, Worker 1200 made a final appeal to the
  crowd. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ants! &nbsp;An entire hive is on the edge of disaster. &nbsp;You may be held responsible for its downfall if
  you refuse to move. &nbsp;We need access to the pond&rsquo;s water.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Listen, bee,&rdquo; began an ant from the back of the crowd. &nbsp;&ldquo;You and your
  water-sucking swarm will have to wait. &nbsp;As soon as Old Yellow Fat gets back on the branch, another race will begin.
  &nbsp;So, take your swarm and buzz off!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh yeah? &nbsp;Well, don&rsquo;t expect an invitation to the Great Cicada Bug-Fellow
  Ball.&rdquo; &nbsp;Worker 1200 said coldly. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all</span> <span class="c2">off</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;the guest list!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Aw, bee. &nbsp;Who cares? &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got better things to do anyway. &nbsp;Now quiet
  down! &nbsp;The final race is about to begin.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 hung her head. &nbsp;Her antennae drooped and she began to wonder if there would be a
  Bug-Fellow Ball at all. &nbsp;She was about to fly off when a familiar voice called out from behind a clump of marsh weeds.
  &ldquo;Seekest thee the goodness in all those worthy and unworthy. &nbsp;But shouldst thou find nothing, do not fall to despair,
  for thy heart shall be full.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand a word you said,&rdquo; called out Worker 1200. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I
  sure recognize your voice, old friend. &nbsp;Where are you? &nbsp;Or are you playing hide and seek again?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh no. &nbsp;I thinkest we have no time for games now,&rdquo; said the voice. &nbsp;And
  stepping out from behind a clump of weeds came the enormous, honey-loving Praying Mantis. &nbsp;&ldquo;Lo, how fares the
  leg?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Never felt better&rdquo; smiled Worker 1200. &nbsp;&ldquo;You know, I never did get a
  chance to thank you, Mantis. &nbsp;I believe I fainted. &nbsp;And when I woke, you were gone. &nbsp;I returned to my hive and
  told all the bees about you, but they didn&rsquo;t believe me. &nbsp;I really wanted to invite you to my hive so they could meet
  you.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then a look of sadness came over Worker 1200&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now my hive may already be
  gone.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, I know. &nbsp;I overheard thy speech to the ants. &nbsp;They are a stubborn
  group.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s putting it mildly.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We must work quickly, little bee.&rdquo; &nbsp;Mantis began to study the crowd around the
  pond. &nbsp;&ldquo;What are those creatures over there,&rdquo; he asked pointing past the noisy mob of ants. &nbsp;&ldquo;That
  group of bug-fellows looks more hospitable.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;You mean the grasshoppers over there? &nbsp;The long-bellied brown
  pests?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, them. &nbsp;Let us see if the grasshoppers will open a spot for thy
  swarm.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mantis. &nbsp;They like the races almost as much as the ants
  do.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But perhaps, if we ask politely, they will step aside. &nbsp;Let us give it a
  try.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Mantis spread his wings and with a powerful flap, powerful enough to blow several ants into the
  pond, he took to the air. &nbsp;Worker 1200 followed. &nbsp;They landed just behind the group of grasshoppers. &nbsp;The
  grasshoppers were busy betting on the races and challenging each other to tobacco spitting contests. &nbsp;They never noticed
  Mantis land behind them. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Excuse us, grasshoppers, for interrupting,&rdquo; began Mantis. &nbsp;&ldquo;But my bee
  friend here is facing a terrible problem. &nbsp;We are hoping thy may...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Mantis never finished his thought. &nbsp;The sight of the towering praying mantis lumbering toward
  them was all the grasshoppers needed to see. &nbsp;In a brown flash of legs, wings and tobacco spit, the grasshoppers
  disappeared, leaving a bewildered Mantis wondering what had happened.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Mantis,&rdquo; laughed Worker 1200. &nbsp;&ldquo;They were frightened of
  you.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But why? &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t mean to frighten them. &nbsp;I</span> <span class=
  "c2">must</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">apologize to them. &nbsp;But I don&rsquo;t even know where they
  went.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re far away by now. &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t you see the looks on their faces?
  &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. &nbsp;And look. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got our space now, thanks to you, old
  friend.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c15"><span class="c4">With the grasshoppers out of the way, Worker 1200 directed her swarm down to the pond and they
  all began to collect water on their tongues. &nbsp;Mantis slipped away unnoticed, into the weeds. &nbsp;It took the rest of the
  suntime to collect enough water for the hive. The bees were exhausted. &nbsp;Still, Worker 1200 made one more trip back to the
  pond. &nbsp;She carried a big dab of honey tucked under her wing. &nbsp;She brought it for her friend, the mantis. &nbsp;But when
  she reached the pond, Praying Mantis was nowhere to be found.</span></p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.1t3h5sf" id="h.1t3h5sf"></a>Chapter 5: Silverfish</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Two suntimes had passed since Silverfish forced an invitation out of Cockroach to sample his tasty
  tidbits. &nbsp;The tingling sweet taste of the crystal cube still lingered on her tongue. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sooooo sweet! &nbsp;Sooooo
  sweet,&rdquo; she kept repeating to herself. &nbsp;She studied her reflection on the shiny wall inside her silvery cylinder.
  &nbsp;She licked her antennae and smacked her lips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Soooo very, very sweet!&rdquo; &nbsp;She licked her lips some
  more. &nbsp;&ldquo;Could there be</span> <span class="c2">more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of these cubes. &nbsp;There must be
  more</span> <span class="c2">somewhere</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Cockroach! &nbsp;I wonder if he even knows what he&rsquo;s
  talking about. &nbsp;I wonder if these Loomers really</span> <span class="c2">do</span> <span class="c4">exist? &nbsp;I
  wonder.&rdquo; &nbsp;She stopped and sucked at her antennae again. &nbsp;She tingled at the thought of finding her own crystal
  cubes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t let Cockroach know if I do find any. &nbsp;Never let him know.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish moved to the opening of the silvery cylinder and looked out into the twilight air.
  &nbsp;A shimmering green light from the base of a dark tree told her the glowworms were about. &nbsp;&ldquo;What do you think,
  glowworms?&rsquo; &nbsp;She paused, as if she expected them to answer. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you think Loomer Rumors are real?&rdquo;
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She looked back at her reflection on the shiny cylinder wall, but the gathering darkness had
  swallowed it up and she was alone. &nbsp;She remembered what Cockroach told her. &nbsp;He spoke of a certain bug-fellow...</span>
  <span class="c2">Scarab</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was the name. &nbsp;She was rumored to know a great amount about a great
  many things. Although Cockroach probably never met this Scarab, he did say where she might live. &nbsp;Her home was far to the
  edge of the forest, where the light of the suntimes disappears. &nbsp;She lived where four trees grew at four corners and bent
  toward each other until their treetops touched. &nbsp;It was farther than Silverfish had ever ventured before, even on her
  longest foraging trips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; she whispered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s time I find out
  about these rumors for myself.&rdquo; &nbsp;And she licked her lips again. &ldquo;Sweet. &nbsp;So sweet.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She slept comfortably all through the next suntime. &nbsp;When she awoke, her mind was clear.
  &nbsp;Her decision made. &nbsp;Wasting little time, she began her preparations. &nbsp;She would leave with the next
  suntime&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;She would find this Scarab and she would get her answers. &nbsp;She gathered up all her best tidbits
  and hid them in a safe place under the mossy rock. &nbsp;She wanted to make certain</span> <span class=
  "c3">that</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Cockroach, and any other nosy bug-fellow, wouldn&rsquo;t find her things while she was
  gone. &nbsp;As a further precaution, she strung thin, invisible threads from an old Eight-legged Hairy Web-Spinner nest all
  across the entryway to her silvery cylinder. &nbsp;If those threads were broken when she came home, Cockroach would have some
  serious explaining to do!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The air was cool and breezy when Silverfish set off on her journey. &nbsp;It was a perfect
  suntime&rsquo;s end for travel. &nbsp;The balmy air had Silverfish rippling with excitement and anticipation. &nbsp;Even the
  glowworms felt the excitement and decided to follow along. &nbsp;Their green light danced brighter than ever as they kept pace
  with the scurrying Silverfish. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t long before the silvery cylinder and the familiar mossy rock were far
  behind.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The travelers journeyed all suntime&rsquo;s end, stopping only to nibble on leaf mold and red
  berries they found along the way. &nbsp;They crossed familiar paths where the footmarks of Four-legged Long Horns left holes in
  the ground so deep it would take a suntime to climb out if they ever fell into one. &nbsp;They passed the grand Ancient Oak,
  standing tall and mighty, towering over its fallen sister driven to the ground by a great storm many suntimes ago. &nbsp;Into the
  Low Land, damp and misty, they wandered over soggy moss mounds covered with ferns. &nbsp;They kept an eye out for the hungry
  Green-skinned Sticky Tongues</span> <span class="c3">that could be heard</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;croaking in the
  distance.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">As darkness lifted from the forest, Silverfish crawled into a comfortable crack in a rock and
  rested. &nbsp;The glowworms buried down in the leaves. &nbsp;Their green lights faded, and then went out completely. &nbsp;They
  all slept well. &nbsp;Not even the sound of the swarming bees, passing back and forth overhead, could disturb them.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Another suntime&rsquo;s end of travel took them farther than the glowworms had ever gone before.
  &nbsp;Silverfish had come this far only once or twice. &nbsp;She sensed the glowworms were feeling uneasy. &nbsp;They were
  huddling closer together and nervously looking about as they crept forward. &nbsp;Their light, so bright and green when the
  journey began, had faded to a pale yellow.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">By the next suntime&rsquo;s end, the glowworms were gone, probably heading back to more familiar
  surroundings. &nbsp;Even though the glowworms couldn&rsquo;t talk, Silverfish missed their company and felt very lonely without
  them. &nbsp;She was deep in the forest now, entering regions she had never explored. &nbsp;The pleasant breeze was gone.
  &nbsp;The sky was turning dark and ugly.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Before long, she came upon the steep embankment of a dried-up streambed. &nbsp;The edge was
  covered with smooth round stones. &nbsp;Down the side of the bank, the rocky ground disappeared into eerie blue shadows.
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about this,&rdquo; whispered Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;It might be wise
  to go back. &nbsp;What if The Great Cold comes and I&rsquo;m stuck out here all alone in the forest.&rdquo; &nbsp;She looked into
  the dark trees bending in the wind above her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Cockroach said it would be a four suntime journey. &nbsp;I should
  almost be there. &nbsp;That is, if Cockroach had any idea what he was talking about.&rdquo; &nbsp;Silverfish walked nervously
  along the embankment. &nbsp;She looked across at the darkness on the other side of the stream. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe Scarab&rsquo;s
  home is just on the other side. &nbsp;It would be foolish to turn back now, if I&rsquo;m that close.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">After much hesitation, Silverfish decided to continue on. &nbsp;She took a deep breath, closed her
  tiny eyes and headed down the embankment. &nbsp;She reached the bottom of the streambed where the stones were slippery with
  slime. &nbsp;The earth between them was soggy and cold. &nbsp;Silverfish moved across them, one by one&mdash;a seemingly endless
  field of stones. &nbsp;She could hear the sound of trickling water. &nbsp; It grew louder with each stone Silverfish passed.
  &nbsp;The spaces between the stones were filling with water, growing deeper and deeper as she approached the middle of the
  stream. &nbsp;She thought she could see silent, dark forms slithering between the stones. &nbsp;Her imagination conjured up fears
  of horrible creatures that wandered empty streambeds looking for bug-fellows to gobble off the slippery rocks. &nbsp;The shadows
  of the trees reached out ahead of her like claws. &nbsp;They danced upon the stones with each gust of wind. &nbsp;Silverfish
  shuttered with fear. &nbsp;Now she had visions of night-flying Beak Beasts swooping out of the shadows, grabbing helpless prey
  and carrying them off to some horrible nest to be picked apart piece by piece.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The wind rolled across her back and whistled down the streambed. &nbsp;She clung tightly to the
  stones. &nbsp;She began to hear high squeaking sounds from somewhere in the distance. &nbsp;They grew louder. &nbsp;They came
  from every direction. &nbsp;They were coming closer and closer.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ska-reeeeek! &nbsp;Ska-reeeeeek!&rdquo; &nbsp;It was right beside her. &nbsp;Yellow eyes.
  &nbsp;Flashing teeth. &nbsp;Horrible creatures, like the night-flying Beak Beasts she imagined, coming out of her dreams to haunt
  her. &nbsp;She tried to hide between the stones. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, what manner of beasts are these?&rdquo; she gasped.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A yellow-eyed creature landed beside her. &nbsp;It folded up its wings and started crawling across
  the stone. &nbsp;It was searching. &nbsp;It licked the stone with its thick, red tongue. &nbsp;It sniffed at the rock with its
  grotesque nose. &nbsp;Then its eyes rolled back and it shrieked in the air. &nbsp;Silverfish edged down the stone. &nbsp;Cold
  water lapped at her tail bristles. &nbsp;She could see the hot vapor of the beast&rsquo;s breath. &nbsp;Yellow eyes peered over
  the edge of the stone and swept toward her. &nbsp;Silverfish tried to flatten her body into the stone. &nbsp;She closed her eyes
  and thought of her silvery cylinder. &nbsp;She thought about the glowworms, who knew enough to turn back. &nbsp;She thought about
  the sweet crystal cubes. &nbsp;She even thought of Cockroach. &nbsp;Suddenly, with a high-pitched squeal, the red tongue shot out
  of the creature&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;Silverfish gasped. &nbsp;The tongue was heading directly at her.</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.4d34og8" id="h.4d34og8"></a>Chapter 6: Stinkbug</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish held her breath and gripped the stone with all her might. &nbsp;She could feel the wet
  tongue slide across her back. &nbsp;But instead of slurping her up, it snatched a tiny midge fly that was hiding right beside
  her. &nbsp;Silverfish sighed with relief. &nbsp;She never even knew the fly was there. &nbsp;The beast squealed again. &nbsp;It
  rolled its eyes and began to search for its next meal. &nbsp;Silverfish never hesitated. &nbsp;She dove into the
  water.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Now Silverfish was not a swimmer, but right now she swam like a diving beetle. &nbsp;She thrashed
  madly through the water, fighting the current between the stones. &nbsp;She never wanted to see those yellow eyes again.
  &nbsp;She would rather drown, and she almost did. &nbsp;At last, she reached the shallows on the other side of the stream.
  &nbsp;Puffing and panting, she scurried over the embankment and disappeared under the leaves.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">When she felt it was safe and her body finally stopped shaking, she peered out from under the
  leaves. &nbsp;The yellow eyes were gone. &nbsp;For a moment, she felt as if she had imagined the whole thing. &nbsp; It all
  happened so quickly.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Dazed and confused, Silverfish headed off on a rather aimless path. &nbsp;She wandered deep into
  the woods, losing all sense of direction. &nbsp;She kept seeing the same trees, the same clumps of moss and the same fallen
  branches over and over again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I must be going in circles</span><span class="c4">, she thought.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Then, just to make matters more difficult, the sky turned wet. &nbsp;Silverfish was soon soaked.
  &nbsp;Icy pools formed around her making it impossible to travel any farther. &nbsp;Shivering, she wrapped herself in the only
  dry leaf she could find and curled up beneath a slab of rock. &nbsp;She fell asleep dreaming about the comfort of her silvery
  cylinder back home.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">By the next suntime, the wet sky had ended. &nbsp;A cold, gusty wind whipped about on the damp
  forest floor. &nbsp;Silverfish crawled out from under the rock slab. &nbsp;She stretched her legs and straightened her antennae.
  &nbsp;She felt much refreshed. &nbsp;She took a deep breath and rolled her head up toward the bright sky. &nbsp;Slowly, she
  opened her eyes. &nbsp;What she saw made her squeal with delight.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">To her astonishment, right before her stood four trees at four corners bending toward each other.
  &nbsp;The tops of the trees touched together and below them stood a pile of rocks. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is it!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;That stinking Cockroach was right after all! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve found the home of Scarab! &nbsp;Stumbled
  right into it, I did!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She scampered up to the rock pile between the trees. &nbsp;&ldquo;Scarab!&rdquo; she called out.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Scarab! &nbsp;Or whatever you call yourself, come out. &nbsp;You have a visitor. &nbsp;Come out! &nbsp;I must talk
  with you now.&rdquo; &nbsp;There was no answer. &nbsp;Silverfish raced around the rock pile. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re in
  there somewhere, Scarab.&rdquo; &nbsp;Still no answer. &nbsp;Silverfish looked in and out between the rocks to see if there was
  any sign of life. &nbsp;All she noticed, scattered in and around the rock pile, were perfectly round balls of some smelly stuff.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Uggggh!&rdquo; she exclaimed as she inspected the balled up material. &nbsp;&ldquo;What</span> <span class=
  "c2">are</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;these nasty stink balls you have all over the place? &nbsp;Reminds me of something
  Cockroach would collect. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got to say, Scarab, your place really stinks!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Why, thank you!&rdquo; said a shrill voice.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Scarab! &nbsp;Is that you I hear?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">At that moment, a large green creature crashed down from the trees and landed squarely on top of
  the rock pile. &nbsp;It rolled to the bottom of the pile in an ungraceful heap. &nbsp;For a moment it just sat there, unmoving.
  &nbsp;Suddenly it exploded into a foul-smelling cloud of green vapor. &nbsp;It was the worst odor Silverfish had ever
  encountered.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cricket kickin&rsquo; katydids! &nbsp;What in the name of Meadowfield is this?&rdquo;
  exclaimed Silverfish.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Out from the green cloud crawled a flat, pointed-nosed green bug with wide, red eyes and a pair of
  wrinkled wings folded in a crisscross over its back.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Uggggh&rdquo; groaned Silverfish nearly gagging. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near me.
  &nbsp;You smell worse than these little stinkballs you have all over the place.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh my,&rdquo; exclaimed the green bug. &nbsp;&ldquo;A compliment. &nbsp;Thank you very
  much. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m quite flattered. &nbsp;But I can&rsquo;t take credit for these stinkballs you are speaking of. &nbsp;They
  belong to Scarab. &nbsp;Scarab the Dung.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Scarab? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s who I&rsquo;m looking for. &nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t that you?
  &nbsp;Aren&rsquo;t you Scarab?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh my, no,&rdquo; answered the green bug as she straightened herself up on a rock.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I am Stinkbug, certainly not Scarab. &nbsp;Stinkbug at your service. &nbsp;And you are... Silverfish. &nbsp;Am I
  correct?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo; asked Silverfish suspiciously.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c6 c25 c54">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&#39;ve flown through your area of the forest
  before.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re about... oh, I&rsquo;d say four suntimes away.&nbsp; Quite a distance for you to travel, if you
  don&#39;t mind me saying; especially when you have no wings, if you don&#39;t mind me noticing.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Immediately Stinkbug regretted her comments, feeling she may have overstepped her bounds by
  pointing out Silverfish&#39;s wingless condition, especially since they had just met.</span></p>

  <p class="c15"><span class="c25">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">Excuse me pl...please. I mean no disrespect,&quot; Stinkbug
  stammered nervously and then abruptly changed the subject.&nbsp; You live beside a pest named Cockroach.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c33 c30 c39 c49"><span class="c4 c13">&ldquo;You know</span> <span class="c2 c13">Cockroach</span><span class=
  "c4 c13">?&quot; Silverfish asked with surprise.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c13">&quot;Our paths have crossed on more than one occasion.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c13">&ldquo;Humph. Too bad for you,&rdquo; Silverfish replied bitingly.&nbsp; So, if you&rsquo;re
  Stinkbug, then who and where is Scarab?&nbsp; Scarab does live here, right?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c13">&ldquo;Not any more. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s gone. &nbsp;Moved away many suntimes
  ago.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c13">&ldquo;Stinking Cockroach!&rdquo; shouted Silverfish. &nbsp;She began to stomp about in a
  terrible rage. &nbsp;&ldquo;That lousy pest! &nbsp;I should have known better than to listen to him! &nbsp;I traveled four
  suntimes and risked my life. &nbsp;For</span><span class="c2 c13">&nbsp;nothing</span><span class="c4 c13">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c13">Silverfish&rsquo;s sudden outburst gave Stinkbug a terrible fright. &nbsp;She tumbled
  backwards and released a puff of yellow vapor into the air. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please. &nbsp;Please don&rsquo;t startle me that way,
  Silverfish. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t good for my health,&rdquo; she said coming back to her feet. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am terribly
  disturbed by surprises or sudden outbursts. &nbsp;They are most upsetting.&rdquo; &nbsp;She spent some time stroking her antennae
  and calming herself down before she finally asked, &ldquo;Now, just why do you insist in seeing Scarab the
  Dung?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c13">&ldquo;I need information,&rdquo; said Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;Cockroach says Scarab knows a
  great amount about a great many things&mdash;if you can believe anything Cockroach says!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c13">&ldquo;No, no. &nbsp;Cockroach is correct. &nbsp;Scarab the Dung is one wise pest. &nbsp;But
  tell me Silverfish, if you don&rsquo;t mind my asking, what kind of information are you seeking?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c13">&ldquo;I want to know about the rumors. &nbsp;The loomer rumors.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c13">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c13">WHAT! &nbsp;LOO</span><span class="c4 c13">...</span>
  <span class="c2 c13">LOO</span><span class="c4 c13">...&rdquo; gasped Stinkbug. &nbsp;She released an enormous cloud of pink,
  green and yellow vapor all together. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now look what you&rsquo;ve done! &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve startled me all over again!
  &nbsp;Really, you should be ashamed! &nbsp;My poor heart can&rsquo;t take this kind of abuse!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c32 c52"><span class="c4 c13">&ldquo;Abuse? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c13">Choke</span><span class="c4 c13">!
  &nbsp;Your stinking vapor is abuse!&rdquo; said Silverfish coughing and wheezing.</span></p>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention that word again. &nbsp;I have enough to worry about without thinking
  about those... those...You know what you said. &nbsp;You said the name. &nbsp;I needn&rsquo;t repeat it.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, let me tell you what I know of the rumors,&rdquo; said Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;I
  know it is impossible to see a Loomer and live to tell about it.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Poof. &nbsp;Out came another cloud of vapor from Stinkbug, blue this time.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Silverfish, you are startling me again. &nbsp;You are just trying to frighten me to death. &nbsp;If you must talk of
  these things, go find Scarab the Dung and talk to her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;ll roll up her little balls while you talk, and if you are
  fortunate, she may even listen to you.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; &nbsp;Silverfish propped herself on a stone. &nbsp;&ldquo;That sounds
  reasonable. &nbsp;Now all you need to do is tell me where this Scarab is. &nbsp;But first, I want to know more about her before I
  go all over Meadowfield trying to find her.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug looked closely at Silverfish, trying to decide whether she should talk to Silverfish at
  all. &nbsp;Slowly, she turned her back, paced about for a time, looked up into the trees, and finally began to speak.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Scarab the Dung,&rdquo; she started. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not just Scarab. &nbsp;She insists on being addressed as Scarab
  the Dung. &nbsp;She</span> <span class="c2">is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a dung beetle, you see.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug
  continued pacing back and forth as she spoke. &nbsp;&ldquo;She is a queer one. &nbsp;She claims she has lived today, in the past
  as well, and will live on into the future. &nbsp;Why I can almost hear her even now, rolling up her balls of stink, singing over
  and over again:</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&lsquo;Today I live,</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Yesterday I lived,</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">And I will live tomorrow.&rsquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She would sing that all suntime. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s apparent she believes she has lived
  forever.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Lived forever!&rdquo; exclaimed Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bah! &nbsp;Sounds like Scarab, or
  Dung, or whatever she calls herself, must have rolled up one too many stinkballs. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s nonsense. &nbsp;Lived
  forever! &nbsp;What a fool! &nbsp;And Cockroach tells me this Dung has the answers to everything. &nbsp;BAH!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A plume of purple vapor came from Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Silverfish, I insist! &nbsp;If you want
  me to continue,</span> <span class="c2">please</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;stop raising your voice at me. &nbsp;Your outbursts
  have nearly emptied my perfumery!&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug gave Silverfish a scornful look. &nbsp;&ldquo;Scarab the Dung is not a
  fool, just a might bit odd. &nbsp;Now please, Silverfish, let me continue.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug collected her thoughts and
  started again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Scarab the Dung&rsquo;s comings and goings are quite mysterious, and I have only heard rumors.
  &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t really know what she</span> <span class="c3">does</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in the deep woods in the dark
  of suntime&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;Some say she ca</span><span class="c3">sts</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;spells upon the Beak
  Beasts. &nbsp;Others say she</span> <span class="c3">calls</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;forth sky-shaking sky booms.
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve even heard she can bring the dead ancestors back to life.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug hesitated to catch her breath.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;But always, at first light, she would return to her rock pile, rolling a stink ball with her back legs, singing and
  chanting and...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Going on about living forever, I suppose,&rdquo; Silverfish interrupted.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. &nbsp;But she would sing something else too.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug
  pointed up to the treetops. &nbsp;&ldquo;There, where the tops of the four trees touch. &nbsp;When the light came from there.
  &nbsp; She would sing and chant about something that she called</span> <span class="c2">Ra.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; Ra this
  and Ra that. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t stop until the light moved from the treetops. &nbsp;Finally she would stop chanting and
  she&rsquo;d roll her ball into a passageway, somewhere under her rock pile... and.... she&rsquo;d disappear.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;All very interesting,&rdquo; said Silverfish impatiently. &nbsp;&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s it
  got to do with the Dung bug knowing about</span> <span class="c2">anything</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;other than silly songs
  and stink balls?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A particularly strong gust of wind blew through the woods and sent Stinkbug rolling away in a
  cloud of putrid pink vapor. &nbsp;Silverfish bounced along behind her followed by a few rolling stinkballs.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Silverfish, you do ask so many questions,&rdquo; said Stinkbug as she got back to her feet and dusted herself off.
  &nbsp;She parted her wings slightly and hopped back to the rock pile. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come. &nbsp;Look at this stone,&rdquo; she
  said pointing to the ground. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Do not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;touch it. &nbsp;It would be
  very unwise to</span> <span class="c2">touch</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;it. &nbsp;Quickly now, it makes me nervous just to be
  near it.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish came over beside Stinkbug and looked down at the smooth, flat stone embedded in the
  ground. &nbsp;A ring of glistening green stones surrounded it. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now Silverfish, have you ever seen a stone with such marks and scratches on it?&rdquo;
  &nbsp;Silverfish studied the several rows of strange markings, shapes and designs scratched into the stone. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look at
  this one,&rdquo; Stinkbug said, pointing to one of the markings with the tip of her leg. &nbsp;She was very careful not to touch
  the stone. &nbsp;&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look like the head of a Beak Beast? &nbsp;And this one. &nbsp;See the
  shape?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;It looks like the yellow eye of a Beak Beast. &nbsp;And what&rsquo;s
  this?&rdquo; asked Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;It looks like a beetle.&rdquo; &nbsp;And she touched the design with the tip of her
  antennae.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Silverfish! &nbsp;You</span> <span class="c2">touched</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;it!
  &nbsp;You</span> <span class="c2">touched</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the</span> <span class="c2">stone</span><span class=
  "c4">!&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug and she began to flap her wings and hop about frantically. &nbsp;Great clouds of vapor came out
  of her in every direction. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh Silverfish! &nbsp;Silverfish! &nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;Great harm will come!
  &nbsp;Terrible harm to those who touch the Secret Marks of the Question Stone! &nbsp;I am sorry! &nbsp;I am</span> <span class=
  "c2">so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;sorry for you! &nbsp;I should have warned you more emphatically! &nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;I
  am</span> <span class="c2">so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;sorry!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish scurried behind the frightened Stinkbug; helter-skelter, running about in confusing
  circles, in and out of thick vapor clouds; running behind</span><span class="c3">,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;then catching
  up</span><span class="c3">;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;trying to calm her down. &nbsp;&ldquo;Stinkbug, stop!
  &nbsp;Relax!&rdquo; insisted Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;Slow down!&rdquo; she demanded. &nbsp;She coughed and coughed on the clouds
  of vapor still pouring from Stinkbug&rsquo;s bottom. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can barely breathe!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You touched the mark of Scarab!&rdquo; cried Stinkbug placing a trembling leg on
  Silverfish&rsquo;s back. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, at least you didn&rsquo;t touch a Beak Beast marking. &nbsp;This is horrible
  enough.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, what is to be done now?&rdquo; Silverfish asked nervously.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m all right now. &nbsp;I mean, nothing happened to me. &nbsp;Calm down
  Stinkbug. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Please</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;You are scaring the bristles off my
  back!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug tried to calm herself. &nbsp;She held her breath and closed her wide, red eyes.
  &nbsp;Soon the choking clouds of pink, yellow and green vapor drifted off in the wind. &nbsp;Stinkbug collapsed in a
  heap.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No one ever touched the stone,&rdquo; gasped Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;No
  one.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Then how do you know it&rsquo;s so terrible?&rdquo; asked Silverfish. &nbsp;She was trying
  to convince herself, if not Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;If no one touched it before, how can you be so sure?&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug
  never answered. &nbsp;She continued trying to calm her most jittery nerves. &nbsp;Much later, after a long silence and once both
  pests felt calm again, Silverfish asked, &ldquo;What will happen to me?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug looked sadly down at Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;I... I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I
  don&rsquo;t know for sure. &nbsp;Maybe you are right. &nbsp;Maybe nothing.&rdquo; &nbsp;Somehow Silverfish didn&rsquo;t feel that
  Stinkbug really meant this. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to speculate. &nbsp;You might be right and the Question Stone may not
  be anything, just another stone.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So why do you call it the Question Stone, Stinkbug? &nbsp;What is the meaning of that
  name?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, you</span> <span class="c2">do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;ask so many questions,
  Silverfish!&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug took a deep breath and began to talk in a slow, quiet voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whenever the light
  struck the stone, as you see it&rsquo;s doing now, Scarab would allow one bug-fellow to enter her chamber.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s just over there</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug pointed to a spot at the
  base of the rock pile. &nbsp;&ldquo;The chamber passage is blocked now by that very large stone. &nbsp;The stone has been there
  ever since Scarab moved away. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s probably just as well the passage remains covered. &nbsp;It was a very mysterious
  place to enter.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; said Silverfish.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug sighed heavily. &nbsp;&ldquo;The chamber walls were adorned with Fluffy Beak Beast fluff
  and the sweet scent of hot seed pod vapors filled the chamber air.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug took a deep breath as if she were trying
  to smell the hot vapors even now. &nbsp;&ldquo;Upon entering the chamber, Scarab would appear, sitting on a rock marked with the
  same designs as those on the Question Stone. &nbsp;She would allow one question to be asked, no more. &nbsp;And she would answer
  it. &nbsp;It was the</span> <span class="c2">only</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;time she would talk directly to a bug-fellow.
  &nbsp;Her answer would be wise, but you had to think about it. &nbsp;I mean, her answer didn&rsquo;t always make sense at first.
  &nbsp;But deep inside,&rdquo; Stinkbug stopped to thump her thorax once, &ldquo;deep inside, you always felt her answer was
  sincere.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So that was it?&rdquo; said Silverfish.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;That was it. &nbsp;And now, please, if you will excuse me Silverfish, I am, as
  you might have noticed, exhausted from all the excitement. &nbsp;I need to go and rest and renew my spent perfumery. &nbsp;I
  can&rsquo;t answer any more questions now. &nbsp;Next suntime I will show you where you can find Scarab the Dung.
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll point out the direction to her home. &nbsp;But, I must tell you. &nbsp;Her home is very far away.
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll meet you here next suntime.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug looked down at the Question Stone. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please be
  careful.&rdquo; &nbsp;And before she turned away she looked to Silverfish and said, &ldquo;Maybe Scarab can help you now that the
  stone has been touched. &nbsp;Maybe she can tell you what to do.&rdquo; &nbsp;And she flew clumsily off into the
  woods.</span></p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.2s8eyo1" id="h.2s8eyo1"></a>Chapter 7: The Tallest Tree</h2>

   <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Cockroach tossed and turned in his sleep. &nbsp;Dive-bombing
  Beak Beasts had invaded his dreams again. &nbsp;They were ripping him apart, piece by piece. &nbsp;Finally, he shook himself
  awake. &nbsp;He rolled from the top of his stink pile and landed in a heap on the ground. &nbsp;Sleep was nearly impossible for
  him since his experience with the Beak Beasts out on the frozen ground.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He raised a tired antenna into the air and felt the wind. &nbsp;It was a moaning kind of wind; a
  dreary moan that carried a bad smell. &nbsp;Not the pleasant smell of rotting leaf mold or the stagnant smell of water-filled
  tree holes. &nbsp;This was different. &nbsp;Cockroach had smelled this wind before. &nbsp;It was something a bug wouldn&rsquo;t
  forget. &nbsp;It was the evil sound and smell of the Loomer Wind.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 heard it too. &nbsp;She heard it from her hive in the hollow oak. &nbsp;It sent a
  chill through her body and left her with a dreadful feeling. &nbsp;Praying Mantis, meditating in the pasture, heard it too.
  &nbsp;The wind interrupted his inner peace.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach shook off the uncomfortable feeling and turned his attention to a honey-coated fruit
  rind. &nbsp;After sucking it dry, he tried to fall back to sleep, but he couldn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;He decided to march around his
  stink pile to exhaust himself. &nbsp;As he did, he thought of Silverfish and said to himself, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen that
  pesky neighbor for more suntimes than I can count.&rdquo; &nbsp;Six was his limit. &nbsp;He knew she&rsquo;d been away at least
  that long. &nbsp;&ldquo;In fact, I can&rsquo;t remember Silverfish</span> <span class="c2">ever</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;being away from her precious silvery cylinder this long.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He decided to see if Silverfish was back from wherever she may have gone, so he marched down to
  the silvery cylinder. &nbsp;Being ever so quiet, he sneaked up to the side of the cylinder. &nbsp;Then, reaching back with a leg,
  he gave the cylinder a healthy kick. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wake up Silverfish, if you&rsquo;re in there. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;
  &nbsp;He kicked it again. &nbsp;&ldquo;No sense in you sleeping when I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &nbsp;He kicked it several more times
  until his leg hurt and he hobbled off in a huff. &nbsp;&ldquo;What do I care anyway? &nbsp;She could crawl off and die for all I
  care,&rdquo; grumbled Cockroach. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And if she did</span><span class="c4">, he thought as he settled
  back on his stink pile,</span> <span class="c2">I&rsquo;d like to see what&rsquo;s inside that silvery cylinder of
  hers</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">He turned his head and looked down from his stink pile and out toward
  the empty cylinder. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c34">No sense letting it go to waste,</span> <span class="c3">he thought to
  himself.</span><span class="c3 c34">&nbsp; No sense at all</span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;Cockroach began whispering, &ldquo;No
  sense at all.&rdquo; &nbsp;And he closed his eyes and drifted to sleep.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Meanwhile, four suntimes from home, Silverfish was beginning to wonder what she had gotten herself
  into. &nbsp;She had traveled on Cockroach&rsquo;s advice with the hopes of gathering information about Loomers from the
  supposedly &lsquo;all-knowing&rsquo; Scarab and instead had met a green, foul-smelling Stinkbug whose brain probably had been
  vaporized by her own putrid &lsquo;perfumery.&rsquo; &nbsp;Silverfish had been taken to a supposedly sacred stone with a
  scratched out beetle design that had possibly left a curse upon her simply because she had touched it. &nbsp;Sitting there alone
  in the forest between the four trees that touched, Silverfish began to consider Stinkbug&rsquo;s Scarab stories. &nbsp;Could she
  really believe in a dung bug that lives forever and knows everything there is to know? &nbsp;And what about the Question Stone?
  &nbsp;So what if she accidentally touched it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just an old rock. &nbsp;And Stinkbug had only confused her with
  that tale about a &lsquo;mystery chamber&rsquo; under a pile of rocks. &nbsp;The more she thought about all the wild stories, the
  more difficult it was for Silverfish to believe any of it.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Why, who could believe that psychotic Stinkbug?&rdquo; thought Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;She
  can barely carry on a normal conversation without her bouquet blowing out her bottom. &nbsp;More than likely, she made up the
  entire Scarab story. &nbsp;That dirt-ball dung beetle probably doesn&rsquo;t even exist. &nbsp;In fact, I think I&rsquo;ll prove
  it. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll go behind that rock in front of the imaginary Scarab chamber, and when I find there is no chamber,
  I&rsquo;ll give that senile Stinkbug a piece of my mind.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">And with that, Silverfish marched boldly over to the rock pile. &nbsp;She surveyed the dark rock
  that Stinkbug spoke of and began to squeeze her tiny body under it. &nbsp;It was very difficult, even for one as small as
  Silverfish. &nbsp;She wiggled and squirmed along the back of the rock. &nbsp;She felt along the ground for any sign of an
  opening. &nbsp;&ldquo;See,&rdquo; she grumbled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just as I suspected! &nbsp;There is no passageway and there is no
  chamber.&rdquo; &nbsp;She was just thinking of how to get even with the shameless Stinkbug when the ground below her collapsed.
  &nbsp;Before she knew it, she was sliding down a dark tunnel with the earth crumbling all around her. &nbsp;Slipping and sliding
  to the bottom, she came to rest at the mouth of a dark passageway. &nbsp;The passage walls were covered with moldy Beak Beast
  fluff and stale smelling seed pods. &nbsp;Brittle White Sticks, like those she once saw in the decaying body of a dead Beak
  Beast, were scattered all about. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cautiously, Silverfish moved down the passageway. &nbsp;The only sound was the thumping of her
  weak, little heart. &nbsp;She crawled below empty Web-Spinner threads until she reached a large chamber. &nbsp;It looked exactly
  as Stinkbug had described. &nbsp;There, in the middle of the chamber, was the rock carved with the markings of the Question
  Stone. &nbsp;On both sides of the rock stood two White Sticks with the remains of Beak Beast heads perched on the top of each.
  &nbsp;The eyeholes in the heads held a pair of orange stones, burning with a menacing glow. &nbsp;The entire scene was convincing
  enough to cause Silverfish to say aloud, &ldquo;I think it would be wise to leave now.&rdquo; &nbsp;And with that, she turned and
  scrambled up the passageway as quick as her six little legs would take her.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She burst from the tunnel and stumbled into the darkness of the forest. &nbsp;Dazed and panting,
  she collapsed right beside the Question Stone. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; she gasped. &nbsp;&ldquo;There</span>
  <span class="c2">is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a chamber, just like Stinkbug said there was!&rdquo; &nbsp;She stared down at
  the Question Stone, glowing in the blue light that filtered down from the trees. &ldquo;If it</span> <span class=
  "c2">is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;true... then... what about the Question Stone? &nbsp;I did touch it. &nbsp;Does that
  mean?&rdquo; &nbsp;She gulped. &nbsp;&ldquo;I really may be cursed?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish spent a very restless suntime&rsquo;s end watching every shadow that moved across the
  forest floor and listening to every sound from the darkness of the woods. &nbsp;As the anxious suntime&rsquo;s end wore away, she
  finally began to rest. &nbsp;She was nearly asleep when Stinkbug, who crashed down from the trees, woke her with a
  start.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Silverfish! &nbsp;Are you here?&rdquo; called Stinkbug as she picked herself up from the
  ground.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m over here,</span> <span class=
  "c2">trying</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to get some sleep.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time for sleep now, Silverfish. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got a long way to
  travel if you intend to find Scarab before the arrival of the Great Cold.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug trotted over to Silverfish.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, you look terrible Silverfish! &nbsp;Are you all right? &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t look so good. &nbsp;Did something
  happen to you while I was gone? &nbsp;I have been worried about...&rdquo; Stinkbug hesitated as she looked over at the Question
  Stone. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you know. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been worried about what happened.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. &nbsp;Just fine,&rdquo; answered Silverfish rather shortly. &nbsp;She
  didn&rsquo;t want Stinkbug to know she had been in the chamber. &nbsp;It would just throw her into a panic and that suffocating
  vapor would be everywhere again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Here, I brought you some sweet berry mold and fruits peel to eat. &nbsp;Go ahead now.
  &nbsp;You look like you could use a good meal.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug gave the food to Silverfish and then promptly pulled a green
  stick out from under her wing, pierced it with her needle-sharp mouth part, and began sucking up its juices. &nbsp;After sucking
  the twig dry she tossed it aside and announced, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to go.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish took another bite from the fruit peel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; she
  mumbled with her mouth full.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Not too far. &nbsp;Just beyond those trees, to the edge of the forest, and to the tallest
  tree in the woods. &nbsp;What kind of climber are you, Silverfish?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish mumbled something as she stuffed her mouth again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I just want to know because I&rsquo;ll only go a few cricket leaps up the tree.
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;m quite afraid of heights, you know. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;ll direct you to the top, Silverfish, if you&rsquo;d like.
  &nbsp;From there you can see all of Meadowfield, including Scarab the Dung&rsquo;s home in the pasture. &nbsp;When you can see
  her home, you&rsquo;ll know how far you must travel to get there.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">With the wind howling at their backs, the two left the rock pile and the four trees that touch and
  headed out toward the edge of the forest. &nbsp;Along the way, Silverfish asked more questions about Scarab and her chamber.
  &nbsp;Stinkbug said she had only visited the chamber one time. &nbsp;The thought of entering the chamber at all was very
  frightening to her and it had taken many suntimes for her to build up the courage. &nbsp;When she finally did enter the chamber,
  she was so afraid that the only question she managed to babble out was, &ldquo;Who in the name of Meadowfield is Ra?&rdquo;
  &nbsp;Scarab the Dung gave her a confusing answer about the King of the Beak Beasts that ruled the &lsquo;Land of Sand and
  River&rsquo; and carried a golden orb across the sky on his head. &nbsp;The answer made no sense to Stinkbug, but she had thanked
  him anyway and then left abruptly after emptying her perfumery.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug finished telling this last story just as they came to the base of a very large tree.
  &nbsp;The branches of the tree reached out far and wide. &nbsp;The top of the tree was so high, it was out of view.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The tallest tree I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; said Stinkbug as she released a particularly
  obnoxious plume of yellow vapor.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The great tree rose from the edge of a steep hillside overlooking the valley below. &nbsp;Its
  massive roots clung to the crumbling earth. &nbsp;Most of its leaves were gone. &nbsp;The wind was stripping them away, one by
  one, sending them flying off into the valley.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You can see it all from up there.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can,&rdquo; said Silverfish.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Shall we begin?&rdquo; asked Stinkbug with a shudder in her voice.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, but let me go ahead of you. &nbsp;I don&#39;t want to be right behind that perfumery
  of yours.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">They began the long climb, staying in the creases of the bark to avoid the swirling winds.
  &nbsp;Stinkbug, who was trailing far behind, was already appearing very concerned. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never climbed this
  far!&rdquo; she shouted up.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Then how do you know you can see all of Meadowfield from up here?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;From Scarab the Dung. &nbsp;She used to sing about it. &nbsp;In fact, she was singing about
  it just before she disappeared. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s see if I can still remember it.&rdquo; &nbsp;And Stinkbug began a discordant
  tune with a shrill whistle-like voice.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">Great trees reach to touch at Ra.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">This tree reaches most of all.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">All the land from here, I see</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">Scarab the Dung is home and free.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; remarked Silverfish, somewhat disinterested. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on,
  Stinkbug. &nbsp;Hurry up here. &nbsp;I can see the top just ahead.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug was now releasing volumes of blue, green and yellow vapor. &nbsp;She called up to
  Silverfish, &ldquo;I cannot go on! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s too windy. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;m too frightened. &nbsp;You go ahead and
  I&rsquo;ll tell you what to look for.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No, no Stinkbug. &nbsp;You come up here with me. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not much farther and
  it</span> <span class="c2">is</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">a spectacular view, even for my weak little
  eyes.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug took a deep breath and climbed on. &nbsp;She began whispering, &ldquo;</span><span class=
  "c2">All the land from here I see</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; trying to comfort herself, &ldquo;</span><span class=
  "c2">Scarab the Dung is home and free</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t look
  down.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug, exhausted and still trying to comfort herself with Scarab&rsquo;s song, finally reached
  Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;...</span><span class="c2">This tree reaches more than all</span><span class="c4">... &nbsp;Oh,
  Silverfish! &nbsp;What am I doing up this high? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s so windy!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish gasped, &ldquo;What a view! &nbsp;Unbelievable! &nbsp;So tell me, Stinkbug,
  what&rsquo;s that over there? &nbsp;And what&rsquo;s that down the other side? &nbsp;What are we looking at?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug shook with fear. &nbsp;Never had she been so incredibly high in the air. &nbsp;She kept
  her eyes firmly shut and with a quivering voice she continued to recite the Scarab song. &nbsp;&ldquo;...</span><span class=
  "c2">Touch at Ra ...Touch at Ra ... great trees touch at Ra</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Come on, Stinkbug. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t see with your eyes closed. &nbsp;We came all this
  way so you could show me Scarab&rsquo;s home. &nbsp;Now open your eyes and point it out!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Slowly, Stinkbug opened her eyes. &nbsp;She looked over the edge of the branch.
  &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Eeeeeyaaaa</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; she shrieked. &nbsp;She pulled back in a panic.
  &nbsp;She wobbled backwards and stumbled off the other side of the branch. &nbsp;She managed to hook the bark with one of her
  sharp tarsals and hung there, kicking and screaming in a cloud of vapor. &nbsp;After a great struggle and with some encouragement
  from Silverfish, she pulled herself back to the safety of the branch&rsquo;s elbow. She refused to open her eyes again.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t and I won&rsquo;t open my eyes! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll tell you where to look. &nbsp;I think I still
  remember the area. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve flown there once or twice.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, very well then Stinkbug. &nbsp;Go ahead.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Look out to the side of you and you should see a meadow. &nbsp;Do you see
  it?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, I see it.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, be careful out there. &nbsp;Robber fly patrols that area. &nbsp;He is a monster.
  &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll grab bug-fellows out of the air or off the ground, stick his sharp beak inside them, and suck them
  dry.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Take it easy, Stinkbug. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t get yourself too excited.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Over to the other side is the high pasture,&rdquo; Stinkbug continued.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, I see it. &nbsp;And there&rsquo;s a blue-green area between the pasture and the
  meadow. &nbsp;What is that?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Probably Meadow Pond. &nbsp;And winding into it is a stream known as The Waters. &nbsp;The
  bug-fellows in these parts have many legends about The Waters. The Waters come down from the very mysterious area they call the
  Smoking Hills. &nbsp;Do you see them off in the distance? &nbsp;There&rsquo;s even more stories about them!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Those far off purple hills, right?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No bug-fellow has ever gone into the Smoking Hills,&rdquo; said Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;They
  are strictly forbidden. &nbsp;Too many rumors come from there.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Rumors? &nbsp;You mean Loomer Rumors?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh! &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t say it! &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t say that horrible word! &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t
  wish to discuss it another moment!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well I won&rsquo;t say it again and we&rsquo;ll not discuss it. &nbsp;But hurry now
  Stinkbug, it is getting very windy. &nbsp;Show me Scarab&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Look down at the pasture. &nbsp;You may see some Four-footed Fly Swatters feeding on dead
  grasses. &nbsp;In the far corner of the pasture you should see a single fallen tree. &nbsp;Scarab the Dung has made her home
  under that tree.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a tree out there,&rdquo; said Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
  out on the branch farther so I can get a better view of that corner of the pasture.&rdquo; &nbsp;She crawled across the branch
  and down to a leaf, dangling off the bottom of the limb. &nbsp;From there, she could see the entire pasture. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yes.
  &nbsp;Now I see it! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s that tree that&rsquo;s right next to...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">In the wind, Stinkbug thought she heard a yelp. &nbsp;&ldquo;Silverfish, you better come away from
  that branch,&rdquo; she warned with her eyes still closed tight. &nbsp;&ldquo;Silverfish! &nbsp;Can you hear what I said?&rdquo;
  &nbsp;There was no answer.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug opened her eyes. &nbsp;Without a thought, she raced to the end of the branch just in time
  to see the unfortunate Silverfish swirling skyward in a great gust of wind. &nbsp;She was clinging to a leaf for her very
  life.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Heeellllp!&rdquo; shouted Silverfish.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug called out. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hold on! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll...
  I&rsquo;ll sa... save you!&rdquo; she said to herself in a quivering voice.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She looked down to the ground far below her and held her breath. &nbsp;She squinted her eyes into
  the wind, and closing them tightly, she unfolded her stiff fore wings and spread out her thinner hind wings. &nbsp;In an
  explosion of vapor, she took off. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t get far. &nbsp;The swirling wind blew her wings back and spun her out of
  control. &nbsp;She whirled and twirled until she thought her poor head would spin off. &nbsp;After bouncing off a branch, she
  caught sight of Silverfish&rsquo;s leaf. &nbsp;It was hovering above her on an updraft of air, like a Beak Beast waiting to swoop
  down on an innocent pest. &nbsp;Wings clattering, Stinkbug maneuvered near Silverfish&rsquo;s leafy life raft. &nbsp;Flying under
  it she called out, &ldquo;Silverfish! &nbsp;Are you still there?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish&rsquo;s tiny head, bearing a curious half grin, popped over the edge of the leaf.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;What a ride!&rdquo; she said, dizzy with exhaustion. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I think the sweet berry mold and fruit rind
  you gave me is starting to come up.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sa-save you, Silverfish. &nbsp;Just got to get a li-little bit closer.
  &nbsp;Then grab an antenna, a leg or something and cli-climb onto my... ba-ba-back.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Silverfish crawled to the edge of the leaf and prepared to leap onto Stinkbug&rsquo;s back.
  &nbsp;Just as she was about to jump, a blast of wind ripped the leaf far out of Stinkbug&rsquo;s reach. &nbsp;Like a dive-bombing
  damselfly, the leaf spun away. &nbsp;Silverfish nearly slid off. &nbsp;She caught the stem with the tip of a tarsal and hung on
  for dear life.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The howling wind blew Stinkbug back into the branches of the tree, and from there, with her back
  pressed hopelessly to the tree, she caught her last sight of Silverfish&rsquo;s leaf. &nbsp;She watched as the leaf tipped on its
  side and fell from the graying sky. &nbsp;Soon it became a fading speck in the distance and then disappeared altogether into the
  vastness of the meadow far below.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh Silverfish!&rdquo; wailed Stinkbug into the whistling wind. &nbsp;&ldquo;I never should
  have brought you here! &nbsp;I never should have let you touch the Stone. &nbsp;I tried to warn you about the Stone. &nbsp;Oh
  poor Silverfish, I did warn you... I know I did!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Far away, from deep in the valley, somewhere near the area where Silverfish just vanished, a
  distant moaning sound began. &nbsp;The sound frightened Stinkbug even more. &nbsp;She had heard this sound before. &nbsp;It sent
  shudders down her green shell and she released a pitiful plume of purple vapor from her perfumery.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The skies grew dark. &nbsp;The winds died to an eerie calm. &nbsp;An evil breeze with a bitter
  taste swept across the meadow. &nbsp;A woeful whirlwind was moaning with the sounds... the sounds of the Loomer Wind.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Far in the distance, beyond pasture and meadowland, deep within the purple shades of a fading
  light...</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Smoking Hills...</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">slowly...</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">started...</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">to smoke.</span></p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.26in1rg" id="h.26in1rg"></a>Chapter 8: Cockroach&rsquo;s Count</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;One.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach lifted a skinny leg out to his side as he counted.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Twooo.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Up came another leg behind the first.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Threeeeeee.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A front leg came off the ground.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Fooourrrrr.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Now he was balancing on just two quivering back legs.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hummmm, I don&rsquo;t see any more red sticky scribble skin. &nbsp;But that doesn&rsquo;t
  mean there isn&rsquo;t more buried in here somewhere.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach tried to root around in his stinking filth pile for more scribble skin. &nbsp;With his
  four legs wiggling to his side, he used his head to shovel fruit rinds and leaf mold aside until he found three more pieces of
  red scribble skin. &nbsp;He pulled them out of the pile with his mouth to add them to his count.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Fiiiiiive.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Teetering on one leg, he hesitated, looked down a moment, and continued his count.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Siiii... uhmuph!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Down he went with a jarring thud. &nbsp;Counting was not on Cockroach&rsquo;s short list of
  skills. &nbsp;But he was determined to count every tidbit in his filth pile before the arrival of The Great Cold. &nbsp;Cockroach
  would be fast asleep throughout those cold suntimes and the pile would be left unprotected. &nbsp;He wanted to know if anything
  was missing when his hungry belly woke him in The Warming Times.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Rotten ant eggs! &nbsp;I hate that number six!&rdquo; spat Cockroach as he struggled to his
  feet. &nbsp;&ldquo;And what are you two gawking at anyway? &nbsp;You double-dumb glowworms have been hanging around here since
  last suntime&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you have something better to do?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was true. &nbsp;The glowworms had been following Cockroach around the stink pile all
  suntime&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;They glittered and glowed in the darkness, wiggling and waggling impatiently, trying to get
  Cockroach&rsquo;s attention. &nbsp;Each time Cockroach looked their way, one of them would scurry down to Silverfish&rsquo;s
  silvery cylinder while the other stayed near the stink pile and flashed its yellow-green light in an obvious state of
  frenzy.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach continued to total up the contents of his stink pile and left the glowworms largely
  ignored. &nbsp;&ldquo;Six! &nbsp;I hate six! &nbsp;Cockroach was flat on the ground again after counting six clumps of yellow
  marsh mushrooms. &nbsp;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something in this pile I have only five of?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Finally, after counting all suntime&rsquo;s end, Cockroach was tired and feeling cold, not to
  mention sore from bouncing on his belly. &nbsp;He was anxious to crawl below a leaf and sleep through the suntime undisturbed.
  &nbsp;But this was not to be. &nbsp;Each time he started to doze off, a glowworm crawled under the darkness of the leaf and lit
  it up like a forest fire and then retreated just as Cockroach jerked awake. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ugggghhh! &nbsp;What was that?&rdquo; he
  groaned each time. &nbsp;Then he would fall back to sleep just to be reawakened by the next flash of the glowworm. &nbsp;Unable
  to sleep, he grew exceptionally ornery and when he finally caught one of the glowworms in the act of flashing, he went into one
  of his finer Cockroach rages.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you two! &nbsp;You lower than leaf litter, less than louse larvae, wiggling
  green grubs! &nbsp;Get out of here before I put your lights out forever! &nbsp;I&rsquo;m trying to sleep!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The glowworms scurried down to the silvery cylinder. &nbsp; They rushed back and forth between the
  cylinder and stink pile, circling the cylinder each time before dashing back up toward Cockroach. &nbsp;Finally, even the
  oblivious Cockroach understood what the glowworms were trying to tell him.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re trying to tell me about Silverfish&rsquo;s disappearance,&rdquo; Cockroach
  began coldly, &ldquo;I already know all about it. &nbsp;And if you expect me to do anything about it, forget it! &nbsp;I have my
  own things to attend to and I can&rsquo;t be concerned about some smarty-skinned Silverfish that&rsquo;s probably wandered off in
  the woods and gotten herself lost. &nbsp;Now get lost yourselves. &nbsp;And don&rsquo;t bother me with your whining. &nbsp;I have
  too much to do at suntime&rsquo;s end and I don&rsquo;t want you, or any of Silverfish&rsquo;s problems, keeping me from my
  sleep.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">With that, Cockroach yanked up his leaf cover and went back to sleep. &nbsp;The dejected glowworms
  knew there was no reasoning with the stubborn Cockroach and they crawled off feeling very sad indeed.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Later that same suntime, Cockroach had a very troublesome dream; not another Beak Beast fright
  dream, but a dream that was even more disturbing. &nbsp;He dreamt that a giant Leaping Four-Legged Long Horn wandered into his
  part of the wood. &nbsp;Appearing from an icy mist, it plodded through the fresh layers of soft cold, deep and white, on the
  ground. &nbsp;It snorted plumes of vapor from wet snout holes. &nbsp;It stripped pieces of bark from the trees, pawed and browsed
  in the soft cold for acorns and then lumbered over to Cockroach&rsquo;s stink pile. &nbsp;There, the Long Horn paused. &nbsp;It
  straddled the stink pile, lowered its great head, and with two chomps, ate the whole thing.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach leaped up from his dream, his body trembling. &nbsp;Poor Cockroach stumbled about trying
  to shake off the horrible dream, puffing and panting, his heart pounding like a Wood-Beating Beak Beast. &nbsp;He could still see
  his last Loomer crystal cube held between the Long Horn&rsquo;s teeth. &nbsp;He could still see his stink pile disappearing down
  the Long Horn&rsquo;s terrible throat, tidbit by tidbit.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;My stink pile! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s gone! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">But it wasn&rsquo;t gone. &nbsp;The pile was still there just as he had left it, with not a Long
  Horn in sight. &nbsp;All the same, Cockroach decided his stink pile was no longer safe. &nbsp;He was certain the phantom Long
  Horn, or something like it, would be coming for it. &nbsp;He decided the pile had to be moved, and he knew where. &nbsp;He would
  move it into the silvery cylinder.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach had been eyeing that fine looking cylinder for a long time. &nbsp;He was certain that
  Silverfish wasn&rsquo;t coming back, for whatever reason. &nbsp;He wasted no time getting started. &nbsp;He dug out his first
  load of tasty tidbits and dragged them down to the silvery cylinder. &nbsp;Cautiously, he approached the cylinder&rsquo;s
  entranceway.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Anybody in there?&rdquo; he called.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">His own voice echoed back from the darkness of the cylinder. &nbsp;The echo startled Cockroach and
  made him jump back. &nbsp;He looked about in embarrassment. &nbsp;He shouted again, standing closer this time and calling
  louder.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Sil-ver-fish!</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;Are you in there?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">There was no answer. &nbsp;Convinced the silvery cylinder was empty, Cockroach decided to enter.
  &nbsp;Slowly he turned his head, looking to one side and then the other. &nbsp;He circled around once, just to see if he was
  being watched. &nbsp;Then, with his heart skipping an anxious beat, Cockroach stepped into the cylinder for the first time in his
  life.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He immediately blundered into Silverfish&rsquo;s Eight-Legged Hairy Web-Spinner invisible thread
  trap strung this way and that across the entranceway. &nbsp;It took a few moments for Cockroach to figure out what he was tangled
  in, and then he panicked.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Web...Web-Spinner! &nbsp;No! &nbsp;Not that!</span> <span class="c2">HELLLLLP!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He tugged and pulled and tore at the threads. &nbsp;He shouted for mercy.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Web-Spinner! &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t eat me! &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want me. &nbsp;I stink and I taste bad. &nbsp;You
  probably already ate Silverfish. &nbsp;Well, I taste much worse than she does. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m no good at all. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m
  tough and I&rsquo;ll probably give you indigestion for the rest of your life. &nbsp;I may even poison you. &nbsp;Oh pleeeeeese.
  &nbsp;Cut me loose and we&rsquo;ll just forget I was ever here.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">There was no answer from within the dark shadows of the cylinder. &nbsp;No Web-Spinner whispers,
  no scratching.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Web-Spinner? &nbsp;You&rsquo;re awfully quiet. &nbsp;Are you trying to torture me? &nbsp;
  Or do you just enjoy watching your foul-tasting victims squirm? &nbsp;Is that it? &nbsp;Or maybe you&rsquo;re considering all the
  terrible diseases you could catch from me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">There was still no answer. &nbsp;Cockroach strained his eyes as he looked into the darkness of the
  cylinder. &nbsp;It appeared empty. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Curious</span><span class="c4">, he thought. &nbsp;Curious, too,
  were the Web-Spinner threads. &nbsp;They were weak and not at all sticky. &nbsp;In fact, he had broken most of them already.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Something&rsquo;s not right here</span><span class="c4">, thought Cockroach. &nbsp;He pulled away
  the rest of the threads. &nbsp;Nervously, he crept toward the back of the dark cylinder.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was completely empty. &nbsp;No Web-Spinner. &nbsp;No Silverfish. &nbsp;No sucked dry Silverfish
  skin. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;It was hollow and empty.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So. &nbsp;Old threads with no sticky left. &nbsp;No Web-Spinner to spin them. &nbsp;And no
  sign of stinking Silverfish.&rdquo; &nbsp;A little grin came over Cockroach&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know what she was up to.
  &nbsp;She figured I&rsquo;d eventually break into her precious silvery cylinder while she was gone. &nbsp;The threads were there
  to scare me off! &nbsp;Ha! &nbsp;Silverfish. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m too brave for that trick.</span> <span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Much</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;too brave. &nbsp;And smart. &nbsp;Why I&rsquo;d have put
  any Web-Spinner flat on his back if he came for me. &nbsp;Bah! &nbsp;And so, Silverfish, wherever</span><span class=
  "c2">&nbsp;you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are...&rdquo; strutted Cockroach, admiring his reflection on the cylinder walls,
  &ldquo;Here...</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;... am!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">With that remark, Cockroach rolled to his back and let out a peal of laughter. &nbsp;It echoed
  through the cylinder like a chorus of Green-Skinned Sticky Tongues.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was the laughter of relief.</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.lnxbz9" id="h.lnxbz9"></a>Chapter 9: Sky Booms</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">On the suntime that Stinkbug arrived at the silvery cylinder,
  the skies above Meadowfield had grown black and threatening. &nbsp;Dark clouds swirled above the creaking treetops. &nbsp;The air
  whistled by the cylinder&rsquo;s entranceway where Stinkbug stood, shouting into the cylinder as loud as she could.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Cockroach</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; Stinkbug
  shouted.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The stinking filth pile stuffed inside the cylinder began to stir. &nbsp;From under a clump of
  leaf mold, Cockroach emerged wearing a sheet of scribble-skin over his eyes. &nbsp;Only his antennae, waving back and forth,
  could be seen.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Is that you, Cockroach?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That all depends on who I&rsquo;m talking to,&rdquo; said Cockroach still
  half-asleep.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Stinkbug. &nbsp;And I have some terrible news.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Terrible news? &nbsp;I don&#39;t want any terrible news. &nbsp;I was very comfortable.
  &nbsp;I was having a wonderful nap. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve worked three suntimes moving my best tidbits into my lovely new home.
  &nbsp;And now, I just want to enjoy it. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m all settled in to sleep through The Great Cold. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t come
  rolling in here uninvited with terrible news to spoil my perfectly wonderful atmosphere. &nbsp;Now</span> <span class="c2">go
  away</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; &nbsp;And Cockroach buried himself back under his filth pile.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But Cockroach, I really think you need to know why I came all this way,&rdquo; insisted
  Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;There is something of great importance I must tell you!&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug stepped inside the cylinder
  to get out of the wind and icy rain outside. &nbsp;&ldquo;It concerns your good neighbor, Silverfish.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; shouted Cockroach busting up from the bottom of the pile. &nbsp;He ripped away
  the scribble-skin still stuck to his face. &nbsp;&ldquo;Silverfish! &nbsp;She&rsquo;s coming back here? &nbsp;She&rsquo;s been
  gone more suntimes than I can count. &nbsp;And now you&rsquo;re telling me she coming back to reclaim her precious silvery
  cylinder? &nbsp;That stinking slippery-skinned Slug! &nbsp;I might have known!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No, Cockroach that isn&rsquo;t it at all.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No? &nbsp;Well, what is it then?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug hesitated, sighed heavily, and in a quivering voice she said, &ldquo;I believe... your
  good neighbor... the Silverfish... is dead.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible news? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s not terrible news. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s</span>
  <span class="c2">wonderful</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;news! &nbsp;In fact, that&rsquo;s the best news I&rsquo;ve heard for a
  very long time!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">What</span> <span class="c4">are you saying?
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;m ashamed. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t</span> <span class="c2">care</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c4">that your neighbor might be dead?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh well, yes. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s sad,&rdquo; said Cockroach half-heartedly. &nbsp;&ldquo;But
  her cylinder is in capable hands. &nbsp;She can rest in peace, knowing her good friend is looking after it. &nbsp;Very sad.
  &nbsp;Very sad indeed,&rdquo; said Cockroach, barely able to hold back his delight.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a slight possibility she might still be alive,&rdquo; said
  Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, no. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; Cockroach answered
  quickly.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I mean, I never saw her die, exactly. &nbsp;She just blew out of my grasp. &nbsp;I
  was</span> <span class="c2">so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;close to saving her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d still be here, if I
  hadn&rsquo;t lead her up that tree.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s gone. &nbsp;No use worrying about her now. &nbsp;Just
  cherish our fond memories. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s as dead as a dung ball.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I really feel it&rsquo;s my entire fault,&rdquo; sobbed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Help me find
  her Cockroach. &nbsp;If she</span> <span class="c2">is</span> <span class="c4">still alive, she needs our help.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Maybe</span> <span class="c2">your</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;help. &nbsp;She
  doesn&rsquo;t need mine. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re the one that let her blow away, or whatever you did to her. &nbsp;Besides, she needs
  me to stay here so I can protect her silvery cylinder. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sleeping here until The Great Cold is
  over.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">At that moment a tremendous Sky Boom rocked the cylinder. &nbsp;The frightened Stinkbug leaped on
  top of Cockroach and clutched him with all her might. &nbsp;She closed her eyes and released a disgusting pink cloud that filled
  the cylinder from top to bottom.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Sky Boom!&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Get off me, you red-eyed rotten bottom!&rdquo; shouted Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">KA-BOOOOOOOOM! &nbsp;BOOM! &nbsp;BOOM!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh I hate Sky Booms!&rdquo; cried Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She held onto Cockroach tightly. &nbsp;Each time a Sky Boom sounded, she unleashed a blast of
  choking vapor and gripped Cockroach even tighter. &nbsp;Cockroach could barely breathe.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">BA-BOOOOOOOM!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The cold rain outside became a torrential downpour. &nbsp;The heavy droplets hit the sides of the
  cylinder like a shower of acorns. &nbsp;Powerful winds whipped through the trees, snapping at the branches and slashing at their
  trunks. &nbsp;A dead branch came crashing to the ground, just missing the cylinder, its rotten wood shattering to
  pieces.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; gasped the frightened Stinkbug as she finally released poor
  Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach scrambled away from Stinkbug as quickly as his little legs could carry him. &nbsp;He
  felt his way through the gassy cloud until he reached the opening of the cylinder. &nbsp;Outside, the storm was raging. &nbsp;He
  decided he&rsquo;d rather face the storm than stay in the gassed cylinder one more second. &nbsp;He leapt out and was suddenly
  sucked up in a swirling pool of water. &nbsp;Swimming in frantic circles, the desperate bug-fellow fought the current until a
  wave of water flung him to the base of a nearby tree. &nbsp;He scrambled up its trunk to the safety of its branches, far above
  the rising water.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c23"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Stinkbug!&rdquo; shouted Cockroach, the wind and water pounding at his back. &ldquo;You
  sure know how to spoil a perfectly good suntime, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">From the tree, he could see his old stinking filth pile, full of lesser tidbits. &nbsp;The very
  best of his tidbits&mdash;the honey-coated fruit rinds, sticky scribble-skins and precious crystal cube&mdash;were all packed
  away in the cylinder, safe and sound. &nbsp;He saw a red berry wash down from the pile. &nbsp;It bobbed in the water below him
  until it finally disappeared. &nbsp;Some leaf mold followed and then more red berries. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh well, a few red berries
  here, a clump of leaf mold there. &nbsp;I guess I can afford to lose a few,&rdquo; Cockroach said. &nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
  plenty more in the pile.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">No sooner did these words leave his mouth than a wave of water crashed into the stink pile,
  washing half of it away. &nbsp;Cockroach cringed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, it was old mold anyway. &nbsp;Gulp. &nbsp;And most of the
  pile is still there. &nbsp;Besides, the Wet Sky seems to be letting up.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">BA-BOOOOOOOM!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">More Sky Booms nearly shook Cockroach out of the tree. &nbsp;The wind-driven rain came down even
  harder; the water below foamed with mud.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Maybe not.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He kept a close watch on what remained of his filth pile. It began to swell. &nbsp;It quivered and
  began to rise up from the water. In an explosion of toadstools, leaf mold, fruit peel and water, the entire pile washed
  away.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach groaned. &nbsp;He turned his attention to the silvery cylinder, rocking in the swirling
  water. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, my</span> <span class="c2">best</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;tidbits are safe,&rdquo; reasoned
  Cockroach. &nbsp;But the wave that just washed away the stink pile was barreling down toward the cylinder and poor Cockroach
  could do nothing to stop it. &nbsp;It struck the cylinder, tossed it into the air and flung it against a tree, where it wedged
  itself between two branches.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ohhh! &nbsp;What hit me?&rdquo; groaned a dazed Stinkbug wobbling at the cylinder&rsquo;s
  door. &ldquo;Stinkbug! &nbsp;You better save my cylinder!&rdquo; shouted Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;You better not let one tidbit
  wash out of there!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ohhhhhh! &nbsp; I think I&rsquo;m going to be sick. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m getting out of this
  thing.&rdquo; &nbsp;And Stinkbug opened her wings, fell from the cylinder, and blew away in the icy-wet wind.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That stinking Stinkbug! &nbsp;Look at my cylinder! &nbsp;All crushed and beaten. Well, at
  least my treasures are still in there. &nbsp;I never saw anything fall out. &nbsp;I was a clever Cockroach to put my best things
  in there. There&rsquo;s enough in there to get me through The Great Cold... But wait, what is that?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A plump purpleberry rolled from the cylinder and plopped into the foam.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hummmph! &nbsp;I was looking forward to tasting that.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A honeyed fruit rind and another purpleberry fell into the foam.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;No more. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s quite enough!&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach fidgeted.
  &nbsp;The battered cylinder tilted in the wind. &nbsp;Out tumbled several exotic egg shards. &nbsp;The cylinder creaked against
  the forked branches. &nbsp;Red berries and yellow berries, egg shards and fungal clumps, scribble skins and root thins tumbled
  out, piece by delicious piece. &nbsp;And Cockroach could do nothing about it. &nbsp;Sopping wet, his antennae drooping and his
  body numb with cold, Cockroach saw his precious tidbits disappear, one after the other.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The crystal cube!&rdquo; gasped Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;No! &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t lose that
  too! &nbsp;I won&rsquo;t! &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t! &nbsp;Not my last Loomer crystal cube!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He scurried down to the edge of the floodwaters. &nbsp;Through the raging storm he could see his
  crystal cube sitting precariously at the mouth of the cylinder. &nbsp;Before he could open his wings, the Loomer crystal cube
  slipped out. &nbsp;It bobbed up twice in the water and then it melted away in the muddy foam. &nbsp;It was gone.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Needless to say, Cockroach was crushed. &nbsp;His heart sank with each tidbit that washed away.
  &nbsp;Finally the cylinder itself fell into the foam, filled with water, and sank. &nbsp;The perfect suntime Cockroach had
  enjoyed earlier was gone.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c51"><span class="c4">*****</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The violent suntime drew to an end. &nbsp;The icy rain became flakes of soft cold, falling gently
  to the frozen ground. &nbsp;The Sky Booms were silent and the furious wind had become nothing more than a freezing breeze.
  &nbsp;The dark woods whitened.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Great Cold had arrived.<br></span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.l39zne90ccog" id="h.l39zne90ccog"></a>Chapter 10: Unlikely
  Partners</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The sky was high and crystal blue. &nbsp;Below it, Meadowfield lay covered with a crisp, white
  sheet of soft cold. &nbsp;It glistened in the early suntime light. &nbsp;There appeared to be no sign of movement across the
  fresh soft cold; not a sound, not a whisper, no tracks or trails.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;But there was one Meadowfield creature out upon the soft cold. &nbsp;Tiny and insignificant
  against the icy expanse, he plodded through the powdery drifts, muttering and mumbling to himself. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  Stinkbug&rsquo;s fault. &nbsp;She could have saved my tidbits. &nbsp;She was right there. &nbsp;If she had never shown up,
  I&rsquo;d still be sleeping in my cylinder, dreaming about all my tasty tidbits I saved for The Warming Times. &nbsp;She probably
  brought the Wet Sky with her. &nbsp;And Silverfish! &nbsp;That menace! &nbsp;She ate so many of my tidbits&mdash;and my crystal
  cube. &nbsp;I might have had something left over, if not for her. &nbsp;That cylinder is no good anyway. &nbsp;I saw the way it
  was tossed about. &nbsp;If my stink pile was left as it was, the water would have rolled right over it, and I&rsquo;d be sucking
  through a fruit rind right now. &nbsp;Rotten slime-sucking Slugs, all of them!&rdquo; &nbsp;And Cockroach kicked at the powdery
  soft cold, which blew back in his face.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;Cockroach!&rdquo; called a high whistle-like voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where are
  you going? &nbsp;You&rsquo;re going to freeze your little abdomen off!&rdquo; &nbsp;It was Stinkbug, barreling out of the sky.
  &nbsp;She plowed into the soft cold right beside Cockroach. &nbsp;She tumbled and rolled to an ungraceful heap, coming up wearing
  a coat of soft cold from her head to her tail. &nbsp;&ldquo;You were probably worried about me, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
  said picking herself up from the powder. &nbsp;&ldquo;I had some scary ride inside that cylinder, and then to be blown away in
  the...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Stinkbug, I have no time for you. &nbsp; Now leave me alone!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ve decided to look for your neighbor, Silverfish.
  &nbsp;Haven&rsquo;t you? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re out here all alone on the soft cold.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Silverfish is the</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;last</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;thing I am
  looking for!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m out here. &nbsp;I mean, I could be back in the woods,
  sleeping in my tree stump, waiting for The Warming Times. &nbsp;But I wouldn&rsquo;t sleep, knowing that Silverfish could be out
  here lost and alone.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Is that so? &nbsp;Well, I could be sleeping too. &nbsp;And I</span><span class=
  "c2">&nbsp;would</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;be if I had any tidbits left. &nbsp;Thanks to you, I don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;So now
  I&rsquo;m out here, facing starvation, looking for tidbits to get me through The Great Cold.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll find nothing out here, Cockroach. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing here but
  this.&rdquo; &nbsp;And Stinkbug kicked up a cloud of soft cold that happened to fly up into Cockroach&rsquo;s face.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, Stinkbug. &nbsp;I know that,&rdquo; Cockroach said as he wiped the cold powder from
  his face.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Then where are you going?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;None of your beeswax! &nbsp;Or bee&rsquo;s wings, or bee&rsquo;s bottoms, or anything
  else!&rdquo; shouted Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now get lost!&rdquo; And Cockroach hurried off.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">But Stinkbug followed close behind, hopping on the tracks Cockroach was leaving in the soft cold.
  &nbsp;After they had traveled across the meadow for quite some distance, Cockroach stopped to rest. &nbsp;Looking at Stinkbug
  with a scornful eye, he said, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re planning to follow me all the way through Meadowfield, aren&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I do feel that four eyes are better than two, Cockroach. &nbsp;If Silverfish is out here,
  we&rsquo;ll find her.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about Silverfish. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t even</span> <span class=
  "c2">want</span> <span class="c4">to find Silverfish. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going someplace where Silverfish would</span> <span class=
  "c2">never</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;be. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t be going there myself if I had any of my tidbits left.
  &nbsp;Believe me, Silverfish would never be</span> <span class="c2">there</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo; &nbsp;And Cockroach
  pointed a shivering leg toward the purple hills, far in the distance. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;There? Where&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The Smoking Hills, that&rsquo;s where.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What! &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t be serious. &nbsp;Cockroach, you need to get out of this cold.
  &nbsp;Your tiny brain is freezing! &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t go there. &nbsp;No bug-fellow has ever gone there. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s
  tidbits you need, you can share some of mine. &nbsp;But then, you aren&rsquo;t too fond of wood juice, are you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; answered Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But why the Smoking Hills?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Tidbits. &nbsp;More than you could imagine, if the stories of my Dead Ancestors are true.
  &nbsp;But why am I telling you any of this?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But Cockroach, what about the rumors. &nbsp;You know... the Loo... Looo... I can&rsquo;t
  even say the horrible word.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Loomers!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;EEEYAHHHH!&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it
  again!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Loomers! &nbsp;Loomers! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Loomers</span><span class=
  "c4">!&rdquo; shouted Cockroach, chasing Stinkbug across the soft cold. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now get out of here!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug scurried off in a panic, blowing out a cloud of vapor each time Cockroach shouted.
  &nbsp;Shrieking and screaming, she opened her stiff wings and released one last lavender cloud and she flew off in a zigzagging
  course toward the forest. &nbsp;Cockroach bid her good riddance. &nbsp;When she was out of sight, he continued on, feeling quite
  satisfied he had seen the last of her.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The air grew colder as the suntime wore on. &nbsp;Cockroach&rsquo;s legs were completely numb.
  &nbsp;His antennae were icing up and his wings felt like they were frozen. &nbsp;He dug into the soft cold and pressed his belly
  against the warmer ground. &nbsp;&ldquo;What I wouldn&rsquo;t do for the tiniest piece of leaf mold.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">By the next suntime, Cockroach reached the Meadow Pond. &nbsp;It was the first time he had been to
  the pond, although he had seen it from a tall tree he once climbed while foraging for egg shards. &nbsp;Unlike then, when the
  pond was bustling with activity, it was now frozen and still. &nbsp;Drifts of soft cold lined the shore, their powdery tops
  blowing gently over the ice. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cold and exhausted, Cockroach hobbled along the edge of the pond. &nbsp;Soon he reached a black,
  bubbling stream cutting through the rocky ground and flowing into the pond. &nbsp;All along the banks of the stream grew rows of
  dark trees. &nbsp;Their branches, heavy with ice sticks, bowed down to the water&rsquo;s edge.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This must be The Waters,&rdquo; whispered Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;The stream of my Dead
  Ancestors&rsquo; stories. &nbsp;The stream that comes out of the Smoking Hills. &nbsp;The one no bug-fellow&rsquo;s ever
  traveled.&rdquo; &nbsp;He crept to the edge of the bank and looked down into the stream. &nbsp;He studied his reflection in the
  dark water. &ldquo;What in the name of dung balls am</span> <span class="c2">I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;doing here?
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got to be out of my mind. &nbsp;But the</span> <span class="c2">tidbits</span><span class="c4">... so many
  tidbits. &nbsp;Up there, somewhere up there in the Smoking Hills. &nbsp;Tidbits piled to the sky.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly his thoughts were interrupted with the sound of creaking branches. &nbsp;He turned to see
  what it was. &nbsp;Something was moving in the red berry vines above him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he shouted.
  &nbsp;The answer came quickly. &nbsp;Riding on an ice-covered red berry, Stinkbug came tumbling out of the vines. &nbsp;The red
  berry landed squarely on Cockroach&rsquo;s back. &nbsp;It split open, oozing with juice, and then rolled to the edge of the
  stream.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ooof,&rdquo; groaned Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;I thought I saw the last of you, you gassy
  Grub!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach, I must come with you!&rdquo; said Stinkbug, picking herself up from the soft
  cold. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t rest until Silverfish is found. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m too frightened to be out here alone.
  &nbsp;You</span> <span class="c2">will</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;let me come with you? &nbsp;Won&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach never answered. &nbsp;His antennae were tingling. &nbsp;It was a tidbit tingle.
  &nbsp;His antennae never lied. &nbsp;He followed them right to the red berry, lying ripe and luscious on the juice-stained soft
  cold and he buried his face in its sweet juices. &nbsp;Just as he did,</span> <span class="c2">SPLOOAT!</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp; Stinkbug speared the berry with her sucking mouthpart.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Get away Stinkbug! &nbsp;I saw it first. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s mine. &nbsp;Get your needle-nose
  out of it!&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach tried to twist and yank the berry away. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let go or I&rsquo;ll twist your head
  off!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Stop, Cockroach! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re hurting me!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine. &nbsp;Turn it loose!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll share it Cockroach. &nbsp;Let go. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s share it. &nbsp;After all,
  we</span> <span class="c2">are</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;partners now.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">But Cockroach would have none of it. &nbsp;He pulled the berry even harder. &nbsp;They wrestled
  with the red berry until they stumbled to the edge of the Waters. &nbsp;Stinkbug was just about to surrender, when she tripped
  over the edge of the bank and tumbled into the stream.</span> <span class="c2">&nbsp;Ker-ploosh</span><span class="c4">!
  &nbsp;Cockroach fell in right behind her. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Ker-splash</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Down they sank
  into the water, as cold as ice and heavy as maple syrup.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug was lucky enough to pull her nose from the berry before it took her to the bottom.
  &nbsp;She came up beside Cockroach, gasping for air. &nbsp;Neither could swim worth a cricket leap. &nbsp;Too wet to unfold their
  wings and too cold to move their legs, they were in a dilemma indeed.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both going to drown,&rdquo; gasped Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t
  have been so greedy with that berry!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Greedy! &nbsp;You call me greedy! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re the one who took it from
  me!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, neither of us can have it now. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s sinking below us. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;m
  afraid,&rdquo; she gulped, &ldquo;we may be joining it soon.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Heeeeelp!&rdquo; wailed Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Heeeeelp!&rdquo; cried Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">They kicked and thrashed, screamed and splashed. &nbsp;They even pulled each other under trying to
  stay afloat. &nbsp;But then, almost miraculously, a handsome piece of birch bark came floating by. &nbsp;Cockroach grabbed the
  white bark and pulled himself aboard. &ldquo;Ho Ho! &nbsp;I made it. &nbsp;I did! &nbsp;I made it!&rdquo; he cheered. &nbsp;And
  he floated off, leaving Stinkbug struggling in the water. &nbsp;She was going down for the third or fourth time.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;Help me!&rdquo; pleaded Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let me drown, will
  you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well... that may not be a bad idea, Stinkbug.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;You</span> <span class="c2">wouldn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">!
  &nbsp;Would you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach paddled the birch bark over to Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;No. &nbsp;I suppose I won&rsquo;t
  let you drown, even though I should,&rdquo; said Cockroach as he leaned over the edge of the bark. &nbsp;&ldquo;However,
  you</span> <span class="c2">will</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;have to meet some of my conditions, you know. &nbsp;If I&rsquo;m to
  save you, that is.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach, I can&rsquo;t keep afloat much more. &nbsp;Please, just save me
  now!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach reached over the side and began to haul Stinkbug on board. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tip
  this bark over, or I&rsquo;ll let you sink. &nbsp;And keep your gassy blaster out of my face. &nbsp;Oh, and one more
  thing,&rdquo; added Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re paddling first.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.1ksv4uv" id="h.1ksv4uv"></a>Chapter 11: Acorn Weevil</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach sat snug and warm in the back of the birch bark. &nbsp;He was wrapped like a cocoon in a
  layer of bark, feeling quite comfortable indeed. &nbsp;Stinkbug, on the other hand, was slumped over the front of the bark. Her
  legs were dangling in the freezing</span> <span class="c3">water. &nbsp;H</span><span class="c4">er frost-covered face was
  hanging just above the stream, positioned perfectly to receive the icy sprays of water that froze to her face.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach,&rdquo; gasped Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;How much</span> <span class=
  "c2">longer</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">do I have to paddle?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? &nbsp;How long? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;re doing fine.
  &nbsp;Just keep it up.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m quite exhausted. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s time</span> <span class=
  "c2">you</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">started paddling.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I will soon enough. &nbsp;But my legs are still quite sore from saving you.&rdquo;
  Cockroach rubbed his legs inside his warm cocoon cover. &nbsp;&ldquo;In fact, I think I strained something. &nbsp;Pulling your
  heavy body out of water wasn&rsquo;t easy, you know.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug rolled her eyes and dipped her legs back in the icy stream. Over the water, she could see
  the suntime growing dimmer. &nbsp;The shadows grew longer until the stream was plunged into darkness. &nbsp;The light breeze
  behind them started to blow harder. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t long before the wind was howling off the banks of The
  Waters.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting scary out here,&rdquo; said Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
  think?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly a powerful gust of wind ripped behind them. &nbsp;It tore into the back of the bark and
  sent them skipping across the water like a whirligig beetle dodging a dragonfly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Stay the course!&rdquo; screamed
  Cockroach, waking up from the back of the bark. &nbsp;&ldquo;Great paddling, Stinkbug! &nbsp;We&rsquo;re moving
  now!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug pulled her half frozen legs out of the water and gripped the sides of the bark as tightly
  as she could. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not paddling, Cockroach,&rdquo; she called back over the howling wind.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of control. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t do anything!&rdquo; &nbsp;And she released an enormous yellow vapor
  cloud, which blew straight into Cockroach&rsquo;s face.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Stinkbug! &nbsp;What</span> <span class="c2">can</span><span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">you control?&rdquo; choked Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The wind spun the bark in circles and then lifted it into the air. &nbsp;Stinkbug tumbled
  backwards into Cockroach and they nearly fell overboard. &nbsp;The bark crashed back to the water and went skipping across the
  surface again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ohhhh... I think I&rsquo;m going to be sick,&rdquo; wailed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is
  worse than that silvery cylinder ride!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Just get off me!&rdquo; demanded Cockroach wiggling frantically under Stinkbug&rsquo;s fat
  belly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get up and hold down the front. &nbsp;I think we&rsquo;re about to take off again.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Before Stinkbug could move, the wind suddenly swept them off on another wild ride. &nbsp;They blew
  high into the air. &nbsp;Up and up they soared; all the way up to the dark branches hanging above the stream. &nbsp;They crashed
  into the branches, and when they did, something fell from a limb and landed on the front of the birch bark. &nbsp;It hit with a
  heavy thud. &nbsp;It weighed a great deal and nearly tore through the bottom of the bark. &nbsp;The birch craft fell like a stone
  back to the water below.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">They hit the water with a sudden splash. &nbsp;Now, with the heavy object squarely on the front of
  the bark, the wind could only spin them about in circles. &nbsp;The object was large and round, but in the darkness, neither
  Cockroach nor Stinkbug could tell what it was.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Stinkbug finally asked looking toward the dark shape at the front
  of the birch bark. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever do you think it is?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;Why don&rsquo;t you crawl up there and see?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No! &nbsp;Not</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">me</span><span class=
  "c4">!&rdquo; Stinkbug answered nervously.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not moving. At least I don&rsquo;t think it is... it&rsquo;s too dark to
  know for sure. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t speaking. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t attacking us. &nbsp;So, maybe we should just leave it
  alone.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, I think so. &nbsp;I think that would be best,&rdquo; agreed Stinkbug.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Just leave it alone.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">All through that suntime&rsquo;s end, Stinkbug and Cockroach sat quietly at the back of the bark.
  &nbsp;As a steady breeze moved them slowly up the stream, they kept a wary eye on the round object, waiting to see what it might
  decide to do. &nbsp;Every now and then, Stinkbug&rsquo;s nervous mind would wander. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s asleep and when
  it wakes up it will tear our wings out.&rdquo; &nbsp;A bit later she asked, &ldquo;Do you suppose it&rsquo;s dead and
  there&rsquo;s an angry mother somewhere that will think we killed it?&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug became very excited when she decided,
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Beak Beast egg! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s about to open up right here in front of us! &nbsp;And we will be its first
  meal!&rdquo; &nbsp;The more she thought about this last possibility, the more it frightened he</span><span class=
  "c3">r;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;so much so that she released an obnoxious plume of yellow vapor from her
  perfumery.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Stinkbug!&rdquo; choked Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why did I ever... &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">choke</span><span class="c4">... agree to let you travel with me? &nbsp;Why didn&rsquo;t I,&rdquo; Cockroach stopped to
  choke and wheeze for several long moments, &ldquo;let you and your rotten bottom sink to the bottom of the
  stream!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach, you must be quiet. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re going to wake it.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;If you blast me again, Stinkbug, I&rsquo;ll wake it up and make sure it eats you on the
  spot!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug promised to control her perfumery and tried not to think about the strange, round thing,
  even though it took up half of the bark craft and was impossible to ignore completely. &nbsp;She tried to put all the frightening
  visions out of her mind and think only pleasant thoughts. &nbsp;But she knew, when the first light of suntime reached them, they
  would discover what really shared the bark with them and</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;would
  discover them too. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach woke to the light of the next suntime and was the first to witness the unveiling of the
  mysterious, round object. &nbsp;He braced himself for the worst. &nbsp;As the darkness melted away, he could see the
  object</span> <span class="c2">was</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;certainly round like a Beak Beast egg. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;It
  wasn&rsquo;t perfectly round. &nbsp;And surely it was too small to be an egg. &nbsp;It seemed bigger in the dark. &nbsp;It was
  brown... no. Green, it was. &nbsp;Dull... no. &nbsp;It was shiny. &nbsp;Strange... no. &nbsp;It was actually quite familiar.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;An acorn!&rdquo; shouted Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;A stupid acorn! &nbsp;Look how dumb you were,&rdquo; he exclaimed
  waking up a confused Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;All worried about being eaten by a dumb acorn. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a
  laugh.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Admit it, Cockroach. &nbsp;You were worried too,&rdquo; said Stinkbug, feeling much
  relief.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;An</span> <span class="c2">acorn</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Just an acorn!&rdquo;
  chided Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;A dumb, old acorn!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Snoooorf! &nbsp;Snoooortle! &nbsp;What&rsquo;s all the
  fuss?</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; said a voice coming from the direction of the acorn.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;An acorn that</span> <span class="c2">talks</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo; gasped
  Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; Stinkbug quickly replied.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I know. But you</span> <span class="c2">did</span> <span class="c4">hear that. &nbsp;You
  heard it snort, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Like a snort,&rdquo; agreed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;But how could
  it?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;SNORT!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo; said Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But how can it be!&rdquo; insisted Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re too far up the Waters, if we&rsquo;ve reached a place where acorns
  talk!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right, Cockroach,&rdquo; agreed Stinkbug as she studied the strange
  shoreline. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve</span> <span class="c2">ever</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;seen trees
  like these or smelled odors in the air quite like these.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Maybe here the trees talk too.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What? &nbsp;Talking trees? &nbsp;SNORT.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never
  heard my tree talk</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; said the voice again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug and Cockroach looked at each other. &nbsp;They were speechless. &nbsp;The dead ancestors
  surely forgot to mention this part of the legend&mdash;the part about talking trees and acorns. &nbsp;The acorn wobbled slightly
  and its snorting continued. &nbsp;A little dust fell from a split that grew along one side of the acorn. &nbsp;It snorted and
  rocked some more. &nbsp;Then a plug of acorn nut popped out from the split and fell to the birch bark. &nbsp;It was followed by a
  shower of acorn dust that piled up quickly around the bottom of the acorn. &nbsp;Neither Stinkbug nor Cockroach could be prepared
  for what happened next.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">From the hole in the shiny, green acorn emerged a tiny beast with two bulbous, black eyes set at
  the front of a tiny head. &nbsp;It had a furry, round body on six fat, fuzzy legs with a pair of crooked antennae that stuck out
  from the sides of an exceptionally long, downward curving nose. &nbsp;It was covered with acorn dust from the tip of its skinny
  snout to the end of its little, round bottom. &nbsp;Tiny jaws at the tip of its snout nibbled on a fragment of acorn. &nbsp; It
  promptly dropped the fragment from its mouth when it caught sight of Cockroach and Stinkbug, staring wide-eyed at the
  outlandish-looking creature.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">SCHNORT!</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; it exclaimed as it
  scampered up the acorn. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been bug-napped!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Its bulging eyes peered over the top of the acorn; its skinny snout hung over the edge. &nbsp;Then
  it began a rather unusual conversation that went something like this:</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Bug-napped I think. &nbsp;Wouldn&rsquo;t you say? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes, yes I
  think you are right</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;And what manner of bug would you say they be? &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Ahhh... Now that is hard to answer</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;One of them is wide and queer with such red eyes.
  &nbsp;And the other... he&rsquo;s not so fancy. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">SCHNORT!</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What in the name of the dead ancestors are you?&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach finally
  asked.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;One speaks?&rdquo; said the little bug. &nbsp;&ldquo;That one... Not So Fancy speaks.
  &nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t he a filthy fellow?&rdquo; &nbsp;And then answering her own question, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Oh yes, I
  do agree. &nbsp;He is a filthy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">fellow indeed</span><span class="c4">.
  &nbsp;And the other? &nbsp;The wide, red-eyed one. &nbsp;Do you think it also speaks? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Why
  don&rsquo;t you ask</span><span class="c4">? &nbsp;Oh, I&rsquo;m not so sure I should.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach. &nbsp;What is wrong with her... or him... or it,&rdquo; asked Stinkbug.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;And why is it is it talking to itself?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;How should I know? &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never seen one of these things in my
  life!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, so they</span> <span class="c2">both</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;speak. &nbsp;Schnort!
  &nbsp;I must inquire. &nbsp;I must know what these bug-nappers plan to do with me? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Do you think it
  is safe</span><span class="c4">? &nbsp;I think it is. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">SCHNORT!</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;
  &nbsp;The long-nosed creature sat up on the acorn and tried to appear as bold as possible. &nbsp;Looking down its long snout and
  puffing up its chest, it asked, &ldquo;Not So Fancy and Wide, Red-Eyed One,&rdquo; it started, &ldquo;What do you two bug-nappers
  intend to do with me?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t intend to do anything with you,&rdquo; answered Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Did you hear that? &nbsp;The red-eyed one says there are no plans
  for us. &nbsp;Did you hear that</span><span class="c4">? &nbsp;Yes, I did. &nbsp;But I can&rsquo;t believe it. &nbsp;Some
  bug-nappers</span> <span class="c2">they</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It keeps answering itself, Cockroach.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Listen bug-nappers,&rdquo; said the creature, becoming bolder still. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was in
  my acorn here... a very stubborn acorn indeed. &nbsp;I never expected it to stay on the tree for so long. &nbsp;I was planning to
  safely pop out during the Warming Times beneath my tree.</span> <span class="c2">&nbsp;SCHNORT!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; But
  now, I see, you bug-nappers have carried me off to who knows where, and you haven&rsquo;t even the slightest</span><span class=
  "c2">&nbsp;plan</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for me?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Listen you little gnat. &nbsp;You and your acorn landed on</span> <span class=
  "c2">my</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;piece of bark,&rdquo; said Cockroach impatiently. &nbsp;&ldquo;You were never bug-napped at
  all.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I dare say...</span> <span class="c2">SNORT!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; I was never
  invited either. &nbsp;Was I?&rdquo; She answered herself again, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">No. Certainly not invited.
  &nbsp;You were bug-napped</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And what did Not So</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Fancy call you</span><span class="c4">? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">A</span><span class=
  "c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">gnat</span><span class="c4">? &nbsp;I may be your prisoner,&rdquo; continued the creature,
  &ldquo;but I am not a gnat...</span> <span class="c2">Schnort!</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I am
  Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;A fine female member of the snout beetle clan. &nbsp;Largest clan in all of Meadowfield.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes, that&rsquo;s right. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s who you are</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;You have
  swept me away from my home and brought me someplace I&rsquo;ve never been and never wished to go. &nbsp;SCHNORT! &nbsp;Now what
  do you plan to do with me? &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t be bug-nappers without a plan.</span> <span class="c2">&nbsp;Yes, you&rsquo;re
  right again... &nbsp;they must have a plan</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, we do have a plan,&rdquo; claimed Stinkbug, nodding to Cockroach for approval.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I am in search of Silverfish and my companion here is...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; interrupted Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;That bug-eyed, half-bit beetle
  doesn&rsquo;t need to know anything about our business on the Waters. &nbsp;Besides, you can see she&rsquo;s half out of her
  mind. &nbsp;Look at the way she keeps talking to herself. &nbsp;And</span> <span class="c2">answering</span> <span class=
  "c4">herself too!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Oh, they believe you&rsquo;re as loony as a click beetle,
  don&rsquo;t they</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo; said the Acorn Weevil to herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes... I think they do,&rdquo;
  she answered herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;See here now, I talk to myself much more when I&rsquo;m among strangers,&rdquo; she announced.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;If you would be so kind as to tell me who you are, we will not be strangers for long.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell her anything,&rdquo; grumbled Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Really now, Cockroach. &nbsp;What would be the harm?&rdquo; &nbsp;And Stinkbug turned to
  Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am Stinkbug. &nbsp;And Not So Fancy over there. &nbsp;He is Cockroach.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ahhhh... Not So Fancy Cockroach and Wide Red-Eye Stinkbug... Now we&rsquo;ve met.
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;m feeling more comfortable already. &nbsp;It all reminds me of a little poem I know.&rdquo; &nbsp;And Acorn Weevil
  straightened up and recited:</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">Acorns are green,</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">The Waters are blue</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m pleased to meet you,</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">And so am I</span><span class="c4">.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Turning to Stinkbug, Cockroach whispered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! &nbsp;She&rsquo;s outta here!
  &nbsp;You grab her head. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll take her feet. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s going overboard.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.yvxfp2oemnbc" id="h.yvxfp2oemnbc"></a>Chapter 12: Dangerous Waters</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;I heard that!&rdquo; said Acorn Weevil with a snort.
  &nbsp;She scampered down the face of the nut and disappeared back through the hole in its side. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let them throw me
  over now,&rdquo; she said, safely inside the acorn. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Indeed you are right</span><span class=
  "c4">,&rdquo; she said to herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Just</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">let those bug-nappers try</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">After giving Cockroach a scolding look, Stinkbug went straight to the hole in the acorn.
  &ldquo;Acorn Weevil, don&rsquo;t pay him any mind,&rdquo; she whispered. &nbsp;&ldquo;He can be perfectly rude at times.
  &nbsp;He&rsquo;s certainly more mouth than meaning. &nbsp;Come on out, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do you think? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">SCHORT!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;
  Should I?&rdquo; Acorn Weevil asked herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Well...</span></p>

  <p class="c32 c30"><span class="c3 c34">I&rsquo;m not too sure</span><span class="c3">,&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;she
  answered.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on over there?&rdquo; shouted Cockroach from the end of the birch bark.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got</span> <span class="c3">an</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;idea. &nbsp;Stick your gassy bottom in the
  hole and blast the little gnat out.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;I won&rsquo;t do anything of the sort! &nbsp;Besides, the Acorn Weevil has
  done nothing except suffer the misfortune of falling on this piece of bark. &nbsp;The least we can do is make her feel
  welcome.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, is that so,&rdquo; growled Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s getting off as
  soon as we reach shore!&rdquo; &nbsp;And Cockroach began to paddle toward the bank as quickly as he could. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;It may have been Cockroach&rsquo;s legs churning about in the water that prompted the
  attack; or it may have been the way the bark&rsquo;s shadowy movement appeared to the underwater eyes. &nbsp;Whatever the reason,
  their little bark craft had attracted the attention of a hungry and very wicked water creature. &nbsp;It was circling below them,
  looking for an early suntime snack.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug was first to notice the dark shape in the water. &nbsp;It was enormous.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Cockroach!&rdquo; she shouted. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pull in your legs! &nbsp;Stop paddling! &nbsp;Quickly!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No! &nbsp;I&rsquo;m getting this gnat to shore. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s getting out!&rdquo;
  &nbsp;And he continued to paddle, more determined than ever.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;Look out! &nbsp;Behind you! &nbsp;In the water!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly there was a tremendous splash. Up from the water rose a slick, speckled-skin creature
  with round,</span> <span class="c3">reflecting</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;eyes. &nbsp;It slapped at the water with a powerful
  tail, twisted in the air and fell back into the water with a hard slap. &nbsp;In an instant, it surfaced again, and then, without
  warning, it rammed into the bark. &nbsp;A quick strike with its snapping jaws, and the back half of the bark was gone.
  &nbsp;Cockroach had been on that part of the bark just moments before, paddling and complaining. &nbsp;Now, only a swirling
  whirlpool of water and the shredded edges of the bark remained.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug was in shock. &nbsp;She couldn&rsquo;t move. &nbsp;Her bottom tightened and her vapors
  locked up inside her. &nbsp;She stared at the spot where poor Cockroach had been, just moments ago.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Co-Cockroach?&rdquo; she finally whispered in disbelief.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the commotion?&rdquo; asked Acorn Weevil poking her head out of the acorn
  and shaking the dust off her antennae. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where is Not so Fancy? &nbsp;Where&rsquo;s the rest of the bark?&rdquo;
  &nbsp;Acorn Weevil raced to the top of her acorn. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t take her long to figure out what had happened, especially
  when she spotted the dark form circling in the water. &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">SCHNORT!</span><span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span> <span class="c4">Scaly Water Demon! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">SCHNORT!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;
  Scaly Water Demon!&rdquo; she screamed bouncing up and down on the top of the acorn. You&rsquo;ve got to...</span> <span class=
  "c2">Snort</span><span class="c4">... go! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes. &nbsp; I think she should. &nbsp;I think she should.
  &nbsp;In fact... so should you</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug&rsquo;s body was bulging at the seams as the vapors continued to build inside her tightly
  buttoned bottom. &nbsp;She swelled up to a size approaching that of the acorn behind her. &nbsp;Her belly started to shake and
  quiver and her hard wings began to rattle on her back.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Look out Red-Eyes! &nbsp;To your side! &nbsp;Look out!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug rolled to her right following the warning from Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;She turned in time to
  see the gaping mouth of the Water Demon bearing down on her. &nbsp;In an instant, Stinkbug rolled on her back, pulled up her
  legs, and unloaded her perfumery with both barrels wide open.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was a sight to behold.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug all but disappeared in a mushroom cloud of magnificent proportions. &nbsp;A volcano of
  voluminous vapor, with colors of every order; from primaries and pastels to silvers and golds; a lingering cloud of color that
  swept across the surface of the Waters. &nbsp;And it came fully armed with an odor that could drop a herd of Leaping Long Horns
  dead in their tracks. &nbsp;It was to be Stinkbug&rsquo;s crown of creation&mdash;the kind of achievement upon which legends are
  made. &nbsp;And it left the Scaly Water Demon belly up in the water.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">In the clouds and commotion of the event, one thing went unnoticed. &nbsp;Stinkbug never saw it
  because she was flat on her back, puffing and panting with exhaustion. &nbsp;Acorn Weevil never noticed it because she had
  disappeared inside her acorn to escape the overwhelming fumes. &nbsp;Neither bug-fellow saw what the Scaly Water Demon coughed
  up. &nbsp;It looked like a wet piece of birch bark. &nbsp;But there was more&mdash;something wiggling in the water beside the
  bark. &nbsp;Something flat and brown and very ornery. &nbsp;It was Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Stinkbug!&rdquo; he shouted, clinging to the shredded piece of bark. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why
  didn&rsquo;t you tell me I was about to be attacked by that... that thing! &nbsp;What was that thing? &nbsp;And what are you
  trying to do? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Cough</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Kill me off for good with this massive gas?
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Choke</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;What a smell!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug struggled to lift her head in the general direction of Cockroach&rsquo;s voice.
  &ldquo;Cockroach!&rdquo; she cried. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Of course I am! &nbsp;Now get your gassy self over here and get me out before I sink.
  &nbsp;This water&rsquo;s freezing!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;With a sigh and a widening grin, Stinkbug dropped her head back and sighed,
  &ldquo;Cockroach, you</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">are</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c10"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Let the Waters fall and rise.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Let the Great Cold freeze the skies.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Water Demon cut to size,</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Blown away by Wide, Red-Eyes.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Send them all and let them try.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drop the Beak Beasts from the sky.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Send them all and see them die,</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Blown away by Wide, Red-Eyes.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Send your wicked and most evil,</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">It won&rsquo;t phase this Acorn Weevil</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve got something at my side</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Take a blast from Wide, Red-Eyes.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Acorn Weevil had been singing this tune over and over from the top of her acorn, quietly at first
  as she began composing, and then louder, until she was singing at the top of her lungs. &nbsp;She was quite impressed with
  Stinkbug&rsquo;s counterattack on the Water Demon. &nbsp;As she sang and danced her tune, Stinkbug continued to paddle while
  Cockroach lay across the bark trying to recover from what he called &lsquo;a moment more terrifying than any fright dream.&rsquo;
  &nbsp;And although Acorn Weevil continued to praise Stinkbug&rsquo;s heroic efforts, Cockroach could only say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  about time you found some use for that gassy blaster of yours!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Nothing more was said about forcing Acorn Weevil from the bark. &nbsp;Cockroach had put that
  demand to rest. &nbsp;Perhaps even he realized that Acorn Weevil had played a part in saving his life, although the thought of
  thanking her or Stinkbug would never cross his mind. &nbsp;And so, by his own silence, he had agreed to let her stay.
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Of course Acorn Weevil still rambled on about being bug-napped. &nbsp;And Stinkbug still tried to
  convince her otherwise. &nbsp;The only</span> <span class="c2">plan</span><span class="c4">, Stinkbug told her, was the search
  for Silverfish. &nbsp;&ldquo;Silverfish?&rdquo; &nbsp;Acorn Weevil asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;A flat little silvery pest. &nbsp;Is that
  who you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes! &nbsp;Yes! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s her!&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug answered with great
  excitement.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Does she have three bristles sticking out from her bottom? &nbsp; Is that the
  one?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes! &nbsp;Yes! &nbsp;Three bristles! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s her! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s her!
  &nbsp;Wonderful! &nbsp;So you</span> <span class="c2">have</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;seen her!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Nope. &nbsp;Never heard of her.&rdquo; &nbsp;And Acorn Weevil burst into peals of laughter,
  rolling about and holding her aching sides.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug found nothing amusing about Acorn Weevil&rsquo;s antics, and the thought of throwing the
  rude bug overboard even crossed</span> <span class="c2">her</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;mind. &nbsp;But Acorn Weevil quickly
  apologized. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry... Sorry...</span> <span class="c2">Yes, we are sorry Red-Eyes</span><span class="c4">... heard of
  Silverfishes... just never have seen one...</span> <span class="c2">never seen your Silverfish</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;
  &nbsp;Cockroach, feeling left out of the joke, and not really listening anyway, grumbled about being hungry for the umpteenth
  time and tried to suck some flavor from a piece of bark he had peeled from the side of the birch craft. &nbsp;He chewed on it for
  a while and finally spat it out with disgust. &nbsp;He curled up in a tight ball and began dreaming about his lovely stink pile,
  picturing in his mind each tasty tidbit it had once contained.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">And so, with Acorn Weevil positioned atop her acorn as the self-appointed lookout, Stinkbug as the
  less than enthusiastic paddler and Cockroach resuming the role of constant complainer, the unlikely threesome ventured farther
  and farther up the Waters, deeper and deeper into the unknown. &nbsp;All around them, things had taken on a strange and different
  appearance. &nbsp;The stream was wider. &nbsp;The air grew still. &nbsp;Frozen marshes lined the shore. &nbsp;Beyond the
  riverbanks, the land sloped up into rolling hills covered with soft cold. &nbsp;The hills grew to a steep rise. &nbsp;Looming in
  the distance stood the peaks of The Smoking Hills.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do you suppose those are?&rdquo; asked Stinkbug. &nbsp;She had been studying a curious
  arrangement of black stumps, lined along the riverbank. &nbsp;Evenly spaced, each stump was connected together by thick, shiny
  webs. &nbsp;It was nothing like any web made by any Web-Spinner from their side of the woods.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s a
  Web-Spinner&rsquo;s doing, I certainly don&rsquo;t wish to run into him!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No, a Web-Spinner could never do that type of web, could it?&rdquo; said Stinkbug.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;But then, what else could?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;How should I know? &nbsp;Maybe that&rsquo;s just the way things grow around here,&rdquo;
  groaned Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;What I</span> <span class="c2">do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;know is I&rsquo;m hungry, cold,
  and all together uncomfortable.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Would you like a little ...</span> <span class="c2">SNORT</span><span class="c4">... acorn
  to nibble on, Not So Fancy?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh sure. &nbsp;A little dry acorn dust to wash down another tasteless piece of birch bark.
  &nbsp;You are</span> <span class="c2">so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;generous,&rdquo; scowled Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">My, my. &nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t he the grouchy one,&rdquo; Acorn Weevil muttered to herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug pulled her half-frozen legs from the frigid water and chipped the ice off her face.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not paddling anymore. &nbsp;I am exhausted.
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;m cold! &nbsp;And I don&rsquo;t care how much farther you and your dead ancestors think we need to
  go!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;All right. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s rest,&rdquo; grumbled Cockroach.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;The suntime&rsquo;s nearly over anyway. &nbsp;Just paddle us over to the shore, Stinkbug.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Reluctantly, Stinkbug sank her legs back into the icy water. &nbsp;She paddled toward the shore
  where a fallen tree, its branches covered with ice sticks, dipped to the stream. &nbsp;In the purple shadows below the branches
  she moored the bark craft as the last light of suntime flickered out. &nbsp;She collapsed beside the acorn and immediately fell
  into a deep sleep. &nbsp;Acorn Weevil, also very weary, carried herself up the side of the acorn, crawled in and fell asleep too.
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach, who had slept through most of the suntime already, stayed awake. &nbsp;He sat up
  listening to the haunting sounds coming out of the darkness all around him. &nbsp;He saw strange yellow lights in the distant
  hills. &nbsp;He heard far off yelping sounds&mdash;sounds he had never heard before. &nbsp;And with each breeze, drifting down
  from the darkness of the hills, came the most disturbing sound of all, the sound of the Loomer Winds, louder than Cockroach ever
  heard before. &nbsp;He remembered a song his dead ancestors had sung many, many suntimes ago.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c48"><span class="c2">When the Loomer Winds howl their loudest,</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c48"><span class="c2">And the Waters grow wide and slow... it is near.</span></p>

  <p class="c32 c30 c31"><span class="c2">Follow the yellow light in the hills.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c48"><span class="c2">And follow the scent of fear.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">SCHNORT!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; I think we have a problem.
  &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Acorn Weevil, who had just
  awakened, was pacing back and forth along the edge of the bark, talking to herself. &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yes, I think
  you are right. &nbsp;We have a problem indeed. &nbsp;A definite problem</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Did you bug-nappers see
  this?&rdquo; &nbsp;She pointed over the side of the bark and wrinkled her snout. &nbsp;&ldquo;Schnort! &nbsp;Of course you
  didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re both asleep! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Do you see how they are sleeping? &nbsp;Some
  bug-nappers they</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">are</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Not even trying to keep a watch on me.</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A water droplet fell from a melting ice stick overhead. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Kaplash</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;It landed right in Stinkbug&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;She jumped up with a start and
  released a puff of vapor, which, of course wafted into Cockroach&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;Cockroach sat up choking and coughing.
  &nbsp;He hung his head over the side of the bark to get some fresh air.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We have a problem,&rdquo; Acorn Weevil repeated. &ldquo;Do you see it, Not So Fancy?
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Well of course he does! &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;He&rsquo;s looking right at it</span><span class=
  "c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Stinkbug! &nbsp;Look what you&rsquo;ve done! &nbsp;We&rsquo;re frozen in!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got ice from the bark to the shore!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what...</span> <span class="c2">Snort!</span><span class="c4">... I&rsquo;ve
  been trying to tell you.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotten us stuck. &nbsp;You paddled us too close to the shore. &nbsp;Now
  we&rsquo;re part of the ice!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Stinkbug looked at the ice-covered water. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can blame this on
  me!</span><span class="c3">&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span> <span class="c3">Cockroach scowled</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;at Stinkbug and grumbled something under his breath.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So what do we do now?&rdquo; asked Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;If you bug-nappers had a</span> <span class="c2">plan</span><span class="c4">, you would
  know! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">SNORT!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; This whole trip seems like a great deal of bother over
  one little Silverfish!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This is</span> <span class="c2">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a trip about
  Silverfish!&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach shouted.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh? &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t Red-Eyes say it was? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes, she did.
  &nbsp;I heard it too. &nbsp;Heard it with my</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">own ears</span><span class=
  "c4">,&rdquo; stammered Acorn Weevil to herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This has</span> <span class="c2">nothing</span><span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">to do with Silverfish. &nbsp;The</span> <span class="c2">last</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;thing I care about is Silverfish. &nbsp;I am out here, freezing my abdomen off, looking for tidbits. &nbsp;Looking for
  the biggest tidbit pile ever seen by any bug-fellow. &nbsp;More tasty tidbits than a bug-fellow could eat in a lifetime.
  &nbsp;No, two lifetimes. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Six</span> <span class="c4">lifetimes!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Ten</span> <span class="c4">lifetimes?&rdquo; asked Acorn
  Weevil.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;Is that more than six?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Acorn Weevil wrinkled up her snout. &nbsp;&ldquo;And what makes you think this tidbit pile is all
  the way out here?</span> <span class="c2">&nbsp;Yes, indeed. &nbsp;Good question.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  <span class="c2">What makes Not So Fancy think tidbits are in this freezing place?</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach looked annoyed and impatient. &ldquo;I just know these things!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;His dead ancestors,&rdquo; Stinkbug replied. &nbsp;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right,
  Cockroach? &nbsp;Your dead ancestor stories are...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell that gnat anything about my dead ancestors!&rdquo; interrupted Cockroach.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Mind your own business, both of you!&rdquo; &nbsp;He turned away and stared off toward the hilltops. &nbsp;&ldquo;I
  saw the lights at suntime&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;Yellow ones. &nbsp;And I heard The Winds. &nbsp;I heard them all.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Schnort!</span> <span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">What light and what
  winds?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Never mind. &nbsp;Quit asking me questions! &nbsp;Just leave me alone. &nbsp;Go back to
  your nut house!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Stop. &nbsp;Please! &nbsp;This is no time to start quarreling,&rdquo; pleaded Stinkbug.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to decide what to do!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, ask Not So Fancy what to do. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s the planner.</span> <span class=
  "c2">Yes! &nbsp;Now what?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; Snort! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">What do your dead ancestors say
  about this</span><span class="c4">?</span> <span class="c2">&nbsp;Some plan</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Schnort! &nbsp;With
  planning like this, it&rsquo;s no wonder your ancestors are all</span> <span class="c2">dead</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;I
  should have escaped from you bug-nappers long ago... and I would have, if I had known your plan was</span> <span class=
  "c2">this</span> <span class="c4">pointless.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, no one&rsquo;s stopping you now, you long-nosed Louse,&rdquo; shouted Cockroach.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;No one was ever stopping you! &nbsp;Go on. Go. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t care what you do! &nbsp;You can go off and freeze
  in a wheezy little ball for all I care!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to get nasty about it, Not So Fancy.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do something! &nbsp;Now! &nbsp;We&rsquo;re going to freeze,&rdquo; cried
  Stinkbug. &nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too cold for bug-fellows up here in the hills. &nbsp;And we&rsquo;ve had nothing to eat to
  keep our bellies warm. &nbsp;No tidbits for more suntimes than I can remember. &nbsp;My body is going numb!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Shnort! &nbsp;Mine too. &nbsp;Look, I&rsquo;ve got ice sticks hanging off my
  snout!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach grumbled under his breath, turned away and headed toward the end of the bark.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;Where are you going?&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;Away from you, that&rsquo;s where. &nbsp;Better to freeze out in the soft cold then
  to freeze on the ice with the two of you.&rdquo; &nbsp;And with that, he jumped off the bark and onto the ice. &nbsp;He began
  slipping and sliding toward the shore.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Wait! &nbsp; You can&rsquo;t just leave us here,&rdquo; wailed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;We
  came together and we&rsquo;ll,&rdquo; she gulped, &ldquo;go out together.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug released a vapor cloud, but the
  air was so cold, it just stuck to her bottom in a purple frost. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on, Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go.
  &nbsp;Oh, it&rsquo;s so cold. &nbsp;Come on.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The bug-fellows stepped off the bark and onto the ice. &nbsp;After much slipping and sliding, they
  reached the mounds of soft cold piled up along the edge of the shore. &nbsp;They could see Cockroach just ahead of them, making
  his way up the first pile of soft cold. &nbsp;His body was covered with frost. &nbsp;His steps were tired and slow.
  &nbsp;Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil plodded through the soft cold, finally reaching Cockroach at the top of the mound. &nbsp;All were
  exhausted, their bodies nearly frozen with ice.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can go on!&rdquo; wailed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look ahead of us.
  &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing but soft cold as far as the eye can see. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m afraid this is it. &nbsp;My little heart is
  slowing down. &nbsp;My body is a block of ice. &nbsp;We are doomed.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yes</span><span class="c4">... Snort! &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Doomed indeed</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Lost and frozen. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Frozen and
  lost</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;Cockroach took one last look around. &nbsp;He took a deep sigh and lowered his head. &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&ldquo;For once... you... might... be... right.&rdquo; &nbsp;He rolled to his back, closed his eyes, pulled his legs up to
  his frozen body and didn&rsquo;t move again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug wrapped her legs around Cockroach and pulled him up to her chest. &ldquo;Good-bye,
  Cockroach,&rdquo; she cried. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good-bye, my friend.&rdquo; &nbsp;She hugged him with all the strength she had left.
  &nbsp;Then Stinkbug pulled Acorn Weevil up beside her too. &ldquo;And good-bye Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;I am truly sorry for all we
  have put you through. &nbsp;Please forgive me.&rdquo; &nbsp;Acorn Weevil never answered. &nbsp;She had already fallen
  unconscious. &nbsp;Stinkbug began to stagger. &nbsp;She clutched her friends even tighter. &nbsp;She could feel herself falling.
  &nbsp;With Cockroach and Acorn Weevil still firmly in her grip, she passed out and all three bug-fellows tumbled down the other
  side of the soft cold mound, landing on something quite unexpectedly. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">It was something that was
  sprawled out at the bottom of the mound; something that had left its prints all across the soft cold and then curled itself up
  for a moment of rest.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; Something big and brown, covered with dark fluff.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach was the first to come back to his senses. &nbsp;As he opened his eyes, he found himself
  laying flat on his back. &nbsp;He was buried in a thick carpet of deep, brown fluff. &nbsp;He had no idea where he was, but it
  was very warm.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So</span><span class="c2">who</span><span class="c4">are</span><span class=
  "c2">you</span><span class="c4">and</span> <span class="c2">what</span><span class="c4">do</span><span class=
  "c2">you</span><span class="c4">want!&rdquo; said a high squeaky voice from within the brown fluff.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be dead,&rdquo; whispered Cockroach to himself. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  not cold anymore. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s very warm. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;m hearing voices.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">So</span><span class="c4">what</span><span class=
  "c2">are</span><span class="c4">you</span><span class="c2">doing</span><span class="c4">just</span><span class=
  "c2">dropping</span><span class="c4">in</span><span class="c2">on</span><span class="c4">us!&rdquo; another voice
  squealed.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach was afraid to move. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">What do you do when you&rsquo;re
  dead?</span> <span class="c4">he thought. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Am I allowed to move? &nbsp;Can you move when
  you&rsquo;re dead? &nbsp;Do I just lie here forever?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; He looked to his side and saw Stinkbug and
  Acorn Weevil beside him. &nbsp;They looked dead too.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Whatever</span><span class="c2">you</span><span class="c4">do. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">You</span><span class="c4">better</span><span class="c2">not</span><span class="c4">get</span><span class=
  "c2">Scratcher</span><span class="c4">going,&rdquo; squeaked a voice.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach gave himself a little pinch. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; &nbsp;He wanted to see if he could feel
  anything when he was dead. &nbsp;He could feel that.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Be</span><span class="c4">careful. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Stay</span><span class="c4">perfectly</span><span class="c2">still</span><span class="c4">.
  &nbsp;Scratcher</span><span class="c2">hasn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">noticed</span><span class="c2">you</span><span class=
  "c4">yet.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach could feel some sensation returning to his legs. &nbsp;He felt a nudge. &nbsp;It was
  Acorn Weevil stretching her legs beside him.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2">move</span><span class=
  "c4">don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2">move</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; squealed the high voices all together.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Schnort! &nbsp;What is this? &nbsp;Where are we? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes, where
  are we indeed? &nbsp;I was wondering the same thing myself</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all dead,&rdquo; answered Cockroach. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve gone to the
  other side.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Other side of what? &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">What is Not So Fancy talking
  about</span><span class="c4">? &nbsp;Who&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;None</span><span class="c2">of</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;you</span><span class=
  "c2">are</span><span class="c4">dead,&rdquo; the voices squealed.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Who said that? &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;Where are those voices coming from?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;From the other side, you gnat. &nbsp;The happy hunting grounds. &nbsp;I tell you,
  we&rsquo;re</span> <span class="c2">dead</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A voice squealed again. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Nobody</span><span class=
  "c4">is</span><span class="c2">dead</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug was the last to open her eyes. &nbsp;She, too, was flat on her back. &nbsp;The first
  thing she saw was a tiny brown creature, standing on her chest, staring straight into her eyes.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2">move</span><span class="c4">a</span><span class="c2">muscle</span><span class=
  "c4">,&rdquo; it squeaked. &nbsp;Naturally, Stinkbug was so startled she moved every muscle. &nbsp;In every direction. &nbsp;And
  out of her bottom came a half-frozen cloud of pink vapor.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now</span><span class="c2">you&rsquo;ve</span><span class="c4">done</span><span class=
  "c2">it</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; squealed the tiny brown creature. &nbsp;&ldquo;Better</span><span class=
  "c2">hold</span><span class="c4">on.</span> <span class="c2">Scratcher</span><span class="c4">felt</span><span class=
  "c2">that</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly the brown carpet of fluff began to tremble. &nbsp;Then it started to roll up and down.
  &nbsp;Before long it was bouncing so violently the bug-fellows could barely hang on.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Dig</span><span class="c2">down</span><span class="c4">deep</span><span class=
  "c2">in</span><span class="c4">the</span><span class="c2">fluff</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Hold</span><span class=
  "c2">tight</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; the little brown creatures squealed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Follow</span><span class=
  "c2">us</span><span class="c4">to</span><span class="c2">the</span><span class="c4">safe</span><span class=
  "c2">zone</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The bug-fellows buried down into the fluff as far as they could. &nbsp;They followed the line of
  tiny brown creatures hopping madly about. &nbsp;With shrill voices the strange little creatures squeaked their directions.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;This</span><span class="c2">way</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;This</span><span class="c2">way</span><span class=
  "c4">! &nbsp;Up</span><span class="c2">the</span><span class="c4">neck! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Back</span><span class=
  "c4">of</span><span class="c2">the</span><span class="c4">head! &nbsp;Hurry!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug could feel something pounding away near her, but she never looked back. &nbsp;Brown fluff
  was flying up all around her. &nbsp;She struggled to keep up with the others. &nbsp;The hopping creatures stopped and began
  squeaking again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Stop</span><span class="c2">here</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Bury</span><span class=
  "c2">down</span><span class="c4">deep. &nbsp;A</span><span class="c2">nd</span><span class="c4">don&rsquo;t</span><span class=

  "c4">reach</span><span class="c2">us</span><span class="c4">here!&rdquo; &nbsp;The little creatures dug into the thick fluff and
  the bug-fellows followed. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">They stayed there, huddled together in the thick brown fluff until the bouncing finally stopped.
  &nbsp;The little creatures gathered together and began squeaking away. &nbsp;&ldquo;That</span><span class=
  "c2">was</span><span class="c4">close. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2">move</span><span class=
  "c4">like</span><span class="c2">that</span><span class="c4">again. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Scratcher</span><span class=
  "c4">nearly</span><span class="c2">got</span><span class="c4">you.&rdquo; &nbsp;One of them turned to Stinkbug and said,
  &ldquo;He</span><span class="c2">thought</span><span class="c4">you</span><span class="c2">were</span><span class=
  "c4">the</span><span class="c2">biggest</span><span class="c4">flea</span><span class="c2">ever</span><span class=
  "c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;A flea?&rdquo; asked Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yes</span><span class="c4">. That&rsquo;s</span><span class=
  "c2">what</span><span class="c4">we</span><span class="c2">are</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Fleas</span><span class="c4">living</span><span class="c2">here</span><span class="c4">on</span><span class=

  "c4">places</span><span class="c2">to</span><span class="c4">bite.&rdquo; &nbsp;And the fleas bounced away and disappeared off
  into the thick fluff.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, at least we&rsquo;re warm here,&rdquo; said Stinkbug as she watched the last flea
  vanish.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Warm... yes. &nbsp;But if we move... Snort! &hellip;we&rsquo;ll get bounced right out of
  here.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And there are no tidbits anywhere.&rdquo; said Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t move
  and there is nothing to eat. &nbsp;We might as well be dead.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, Cockroach! &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t talk that way.&rdquo; said Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly, the fluff began moving again. &nbsp;Not as violently as before. &nbsp;Just a steady
  bounce.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Snort! &nbsp;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; snapped Cockroach. &ldquo;Who moved?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any of us did,&rdquo; said Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;This Scratchercoat
  just started on its own. &nbsp;We better dig in and hang on tight. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s really getting bouncy!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;Acorn Weevil was just beginning to dig down in the fluff when a hard bounce tossed her back
  up in the air. &nbsp;She hung on to the ends of the brown fluff, high above the others.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Acorn Weevil? &nbsp;You still there?&rdquo; called out Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes... snort... I&rsquo;m up here... near the top... hanging on.&rdquo; &nbsp;From her
  position, Acorn Weevil could see across the top of the fluff. &nbsp;She could see rows of bare trees and mounds of soft cold
  flashing past. &nbsp;She hung on tighter as the bouncing grew quicker and the trees flew by faster. &nbsp;Cold air blew across
  her back.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do you see up there?&rdquo; called out Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh... just Meadowfield...</span> <span class="c2">Snort</span><span class="c4">!... passing
  me by.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly, the bouncing stopped. &nbsp;The trees and the mounds of soft cold were gone. &nbsp;The
  cold air had become a warm, yellow light. &nbsp;Acorn Weevil found herself surrounded by incredible sights. &nbsp;More than just
  incredible, it was beyond description. &nbsp;It was beyond anything a bug-fellow could imagine, even in the wildest fright
  dream.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">With her bulbous black eyes nearly popping out of her head, Acorn Weevil gazed about in utter
  disbelief. &nbsp;Finally, in a stammering whisper she said, &ldquo;W-w-wide... Red Eyes. &nbsp;Not So Fa... Fa... Fancy. &nbsp;We
  don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re in Meadowfield anymore.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.z337ya" id="h.z337ya"></a>Chapter 14: Grand Daddy Long-Legs</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;I smell it,&rdquo; whispered Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;I
  smell it! &nbsp;Look out! &nbsp;Out of the way!&rdquo; he shouted. &nbsp;With his antennae spinning wildly, Cockroach rushed past
  Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;I smell it!&rdquo; He scurried up to the top of the fluff. &nbsp;Odors and aromas tickled
  Cockroach&rsquo;s antennae from every direction. &nbsp;Finally he could stand it no longer. &nbsp;He fired his wings open and
  took off. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Not So Fancy, where are you going? &nbsp;SCHNORT! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes!
  &nbsp;Where indeed is he going in this strange place</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach never answered. &nbsp;He vanished into the yellow light. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t even stop
  to look around. &nbsp;If he had, he would have seen some amazing sights. &nbsp;He would have seen the crackling fire surrounded
  by a neat arrangement of stones. &nbsp;He would have seen the head of a Long-Horn hanging above it. &nbsp;He would have noticed
  the smoothness of the ground and noticed there were no trees, grass, or dirt. &nbsp;He would have seen the colorful patterned
  objects towering on finely pruned stumps of wood. &nbsp;All along the edge of this astonishing land, the ground rose straight up
  to meet the flat wall that hung in the air where the sky should have been. &nbsp;He never noticed this. &nbsp;He never noticed
  anything because there was only one thing on his tiny mind. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Find where those delicious odors were
  coming from</span><span class="c4">!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He followed the odors out of the yellow-light area into a much darker region. &nbsp;The ground was
  different here. &nbsp;It was covered with slippery black and white squares. &nbsp;Cockroach tried to race across them, but his
  legs slipped out from under him. &nbsp;He skidded off, spinning about in circles. &nbsp;He ended up on his back, kicking at the
  air, slipping and sliding until he smacked into a big, white thing on the far side of the squares.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Whoa! What kind of ground is this?&rdquo; exclaimed Cockroach struggling to his feet. He
  looked up to see what he had run into. &nbsp;&ldquo;And what is this?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was an enormous white box. &nbsp;It made a strange humming noise, like the sound of that
  annoying beehive back in the forest. &nbsp;Cockroach crawled under the humming box. &nbsp;It was dark and warm under the box,
  filthy with dirt and grime, just the way Cockroach liked it. &nbsp;Best of all, there were all types of flavorful tidbits
  scattered about in the dust. &nbsp;Some were crunchy, some were soft and soggy, some were melted down into sticky pools of who
  knows what. &nbsp;They were all delightful and Cockroach shoved them into his mouth as quickly as he could, one after the
  other.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly a shaft of yellow light burst through the darkness below the humming box. &nbsp;The
  ground rumbled. &nbsp;Cockroach started to crawl out to investigate, but he ducked back when he spotted two wide, flat things
  approaching the box. &nbsp;The wide, flat things slapped across the black and white squares, one behind the other. &nbsp;They
  stopped, side-by-side, right in front of the humming box. &nbsp;Cockroach had no idea what they were, but they didn&rsquo;t look
  good and they didn&rsquo;t smell good. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly, the box shook with all sorts of rattles and rackets. &nbsp;Delicious aromas filled the
  air. &nbsp;The odors poured down from the humming box and Cockroach wanted to rush out and bathe himself in the fragrances.
  &nbsp;But those two wide, flat things; they looked bad. &nbsp;They smelled bad. &nbsp;Cockroach recognized the smell. &nbsp;He
  smelled it before. &nbsp;He smelled it on the Loomer Winds. &nbsp;He smelled it when he stayed awake on The Waters watching the
  lights on the hills and listening to the faraway yelping sounds. &nbsp;It was the scent his dead ancestor&rsquo;s spoke of.
  &nbsp;It was</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the scent of fear</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;And it was bad.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">While Cockroach hid beneath the humming box, Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil were hanging onto the brown
  fluff. &nbsp;It was bouncing up and down again and making horrible howling sounds. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hang on any
  longer,&rdquo; said Stinkbug. &nbsp;Then, with a final bounce, both she and Acorn Weevil were hurled through the air. &nbsp;They
  landed on the hard ground where they ran around in confusing circles for several moments. &nbsp;Finally they scurried off until
  the brown fluff was well out of sight. &nbsp;They dashed below one of the colorful, towering objects on finely pruned stumps of
  wood. &nbsp;Once there, they hid in the shadows, afraid to move a single body bristle.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Wh-where do you suppose Cockroach is?&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug finally asked.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I have no idea. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Snort</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;In
  fact... where</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">are</span> <span class="c2">we</span><span class=
  "c4">?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I have no idea where we are. &nbsp;But we need to find Cockroach.
  &nbsp;I mean, he&rsquo;s part of the team. &nbsp;Right?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Su-sure. &nbsp;Whatever you say. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re the one with the plan. &nbsp; So, go
  ahead Red-Eyes... snort... lead the way.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug began to creep forward, ever so slowly, toward the edge of the ground that rose straight
  up to meet the sky wall. &nbsp;They crept along at a Slug&rsquo;s pace. &nbsp;Poor Stinkbug was shaking with fear and passing out
  pale, yellow vapors with every step. &nbsp;&ldquo;Cockroach,&rdquo; she whispered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where</span><span class=
  "c2">&nbsp;are</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Not So Fancy...</span> <span class="c2">Snort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Come out.
  &nbsp;Come out wherever you are.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly, much to the complete surprise of the two bugs, a voice bellowed out above them.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Great Gobs of Cob-Webs!</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span> <span class="c4">We&rsquo;re</span><span class=
  "c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">being invaded!&rdquo; &nbsp;It startled Acorn Weevil and Stinkbug out of their shells and they
  started to scramble away. &nbsp;A long-legged creature dropped from the air and landed directly in their path.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Attack from the rear!&rdquo; the creature shouted. &nbsp;&ldquo;Cut them off at the pass! &nbsp;Bring up the
  reinforcements! &nbsp;To arms! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">To arms</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;The pests are coming!
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The pests are coming</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dead!&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Hairy
  Web-Spinner.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What! &nbsp;Where?&rdquo; gasped the long-legged creature, looking all about.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see one. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t see a Web-Spinner anywhere. &nbsp;Tell me,</span> <span class=
  "c2">quick</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Where is it? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t just stand there! &nbsp;Tell me and I&rsquo;ll defend
  our position to the</span> <span class="c2">death</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, what is going on?&rdquo; pleaded Acorn Weevil who was curled up in a tight, shivering
  ball of fright.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You despicable creature! &nbsp; Don&rsquo;t taunt us,&rdquo; whined Stinkbug.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Just go on and eat us. &nbsp;Get it over with!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What? &nbsp;Eat you!&rdquo; the creature exclaimed and he started to laugh.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Ho, ho, ho! &nbsp;That</span> <span class="c2">is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a good one. &nbsp;Eat you? &nbsp;To
  arms! &nbsp;To arms! &nbsp;These pests are a mighty meal.&rdquo; &nbsp;And the creature straightened himself up on his eight
  spindly legs, turned his two stalked eyes to Stinkbug and announced, &ldquo;I am</span><span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a Web-Spinner. &nbsp;Can&rsquo;t even spin a web, for that
  matter. &nbsp;Of course, I do have a few cobwebs up in my brain. &nbsp;At my age, these things can be expected.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You... you&rsquo;re not a Web-Spinner?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; insisted the creature. &nbsp;&ldquo;Allow me to introduce
  myself.&rdquo; &nbsp;He held out a wobbly leg. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am Grand Daddy Long-Legs. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s who I&rsquo;ve
  been for as long as I can remember. &nbsp;A-hem, although, you know, at my age, memory can play funny tricks. &nbsp;I am
  commander-in-chief around here. &nbsp;An old soldier never dies.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Grand Daddy Long-Legs was quite a sight. &nbsp;His round little body hung between eight incredibly
  long and fragile legs. &nbsp;As he talked, two particularly long front legs waved back and forth while his two stalked eyes
  danced about uncontrollably. &nbsp;&ldquo;So where is the rest of your invasion force?&rdquo; asked Grand Daddy Long-Legs waving
  his legs wildly.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Invasion force?&rdquo; said Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Did he say
  invasion force</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo; she asked herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, of course that&rsquo;s what he said.
  &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t you listen?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I really wouldn&rsquo;t call this an invasion force, Mr. Long Legs,&rdquo; Stinkbug
  replied. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the two of us. &nbsp;Well, the two of us and one other bug-fellow, Cockroach. &nbsp;But we
  don&rsquo;t know where he is.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hummmph. &nbsp;You are right. &nbsp;You aren&rsquo;t much of an invasion force, are you?
  &nbsp;I can remember invading this place with thousands and thousands of troops. &nbsp;Ohhhh,</span><span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">was</span> <span class="c2">that</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;ever something to see.
  &nbsp;Now</span> <span class="c2">that</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was an invasion.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure it was,&rdquo; replied Stinkbug somewhat disinterested.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;But tell us,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;just what</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is</span><span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">this place? &nbsp;Where are we anyway?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh. &nbsp;Now you</span> <span class="c2">would</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;ask
  that?&rdquo; &nbsp;Grand Daddy Long-Legs scowled. &nbsp;&ldquo;And you know what? &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t for the life of me
  remember.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know where he is?&rdquo; scoffed Acorn Weevil.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Did he really say that</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo; she asked herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;In a while I should think of it. &nbsp;It will come to me eventually. &nbsp;It almost
  always does.&rdquo; &nbsp;Grand Daddy Long-Legs crossed his two front legs and started to think very hard.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ask him if he&rsquo;s seen Not So Fancy,&rdquo; Acorn Weevil said to herself.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">No, you ask</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">him if you want to
  know</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; she argued with herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;All right. &nbsp;Fine, I will.&rdquo; &nbsp;And Acorn
  Weevil approached Grand Daddy Long-Legs. &nbsp;&ldquo;So... have you seen Not So Fancy... my nasty old
  bug-napper?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Cockroach,&rdquo; added Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hummmph! &nbsp;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; mumbled Grand Daddy Long-Legs.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Please, one question at a time. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m still working on the first one.&rdquo; &nbsp;He started thinking
  again, and as he thought, he muttered to himself. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hummmph! &nbsp;So many questions from such a small invasion.
  &nbsp;They want to know about a Not So Fancy? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know about a Cockroach. &nbsp;Saw a little silvery pest some
  time back. &nbsp;Saw her come in here through the cracks.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What? &nbsp;What did you say?&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug with great excitement.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Did you say you saw a silvery bug-fellow come this way?&rdquo; &nbsp;She turned and picked up Acorn Weevil and
  shouted in her face. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Silverfish! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s Silverfish he saw.&rdquo; &nbsp;Acorn Weevil nodded
  her head up and down. &nbsp;Stinkbug promptly dropped Acorn Weevil with a thud and turned back to Grand Daddy Long-Legs.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Silverfish! &nbsp;You saw Silverfish! &nbsp;Where is she? &nbsp;Where is she now?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Where is who?&rdquo; asked Grand Daddy Long-Legs, looking very confused.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The silvery bug-fellow. &nbsp;Silverfish! &nbsp;You just said you saw
  her!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I did?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, of course you did!&rdquo; shouted Stinkbug, growing more and more
  impatient.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t that funny? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t remember saying a thing about a silver
  pest. &nbsp;Not at all. &nbsp;A silvery one you say? &nbsp;Hummmph, not really sure I&rsquo;ve ever seen a silvery pest before.
  &nbsp;Seen brown ones and green ones like you, but silver? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think so. &nbsp;No, I&rsquo;m quite sure you are
  mistaken. &nbsp;Now getting back to your first question... What was it?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;While Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil tried to make sense out of Grand Daddy Long-Legs&rsquo;s
  nonsense, Cockroach was busy running into problems of his own. &nbsp;The wide, flat things had been coming back to the humming
  box over and over again. &nbsp;Every time they arrived, the box shook and the wonderful aromas poured out again. &nbsp;Cockroach
  tried to hold himself back, but the aromas were just too powerful to resist. &nbsp;Before he knew it, he was running up the side
  of the box and diving straight into a pile of mushy-white, tidbit-type stuff. &nbsp;The humming box shook all around him.
  &nbsp;There was a deep thud. &nbsp;Suddenly everything went... black... cold... and</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">...very</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">...very</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">...quiet.</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.3j2qqm3" id="h.3j2qqm3"></a>Chapter 15: Tidbit Bliss</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4">&nbsp;Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil gave up on</span> <span class="c3">the</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;batty Grand Daddy Long-Legs and excused themselves politely to look for Cockroach on their own. &nbsp;Grand Daddy
  Long-Legs never even saw them leave. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Nervously, they began to tiptoe across the yellow-light area. &nbsp;In the distance, the fire in
  the rock pile crackled and glowed. &nbsp;They crept below the enormous objects on finely pruned stumps, wrestling with clumps of
  dust they encountered there. &nbsp;After untangling herself from a particularly stubborn wad of dust, Stinkbug noticed something
  in the far corner of the yellow-light area. &nbsp;It was a tall, luscious-looking plant. &nbsp;It was odd looking, not like
  anything she had ever seen before. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">But nothing looks normal around here</span><span class="c4">,
  she thought. &nbsp;Odd or not, its branches would surely be full of sweet juices to fill her poor, empty stomach. &nbsp;With
  great excitement, Stinkbug pumped up her wings and took to the air. &nbsp;She circled the plant once or twice before crashing
  down on its waxy leaves. &nbsp;She was hungry enough to suck the plant dry, but when she tried to plunge her needle nose into the
  shiny stem, it just bounced off. &nbsp;She tried again and again until her nose was too sore to continue. &nbsp;&ldquo;What kind
  of plant is this?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &nbsp;&ldquo;It looks like a plant. &nbsp;But it doesn&rsquo;t smell like one, or feel
  like one. &nbsp;And there are none of those soft tickly hairs. &nbsp;This is hard and tasteless. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think
  there&rsquo;s any juice in it at all. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;m</span> <span class="c2">so</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;hungry!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Snort! &nbsp;You may as well come down, Red-Eyes,&rdquo; Acorn Weevil shouted.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I just tried to suck on a root... and there aren&rsquo;t any. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes, it&rsquo;s true.
  &nbsp;No roots at all</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; she said to herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">A useless,
  rootless plant</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">At the same time that Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil were trying to figure out how a plant could grow
  without a single root, Cockroach was rooting his way through yet another pile of humming box tidbits. &nbsp;He was attempting to
  sample them all. &nbsp;He slugged, slurped, and sucked down everything he could sink his face into, gnawing through clear plastic
  film until he had a hole big enough to stick his tongue in. &nbsp;Then he spat and licked and licked and spat through that tidbit
  too. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This must be it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, finally stopping to catch his breath.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;This must be the place of legend... the endless tidbits... more than any bug-fellow could ever imagine, just the way
  the dead ancestors&rsquo; stories said it would be! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve found it! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve really found it!&rdquo; &nbsp;And
  he sank his head in a mushy pile of white tidbits covered with brown drippings.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Never had Cockroach eaten so much. &nbsp;His sides ached and his belly dragged; but he was
  determined to dine on every delicacy and not leave one tidbit untested. &nbsp;Far to the back of the box, he came upon a
  quivering mound of clear, orange stuff. &nbsp;It was cold and sweet to the taste. &nbsp;It jiggled all over when Cockroach licked
  it with his tongue. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hummmm. &nbsp;Sweet. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">So</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;sweet,&rdquo;
  he groaned with pleasure. &nbsp;He rubbed his belly and said, &ldquo;And I believe I still have room for it.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Inside the orange mound, Cockroach could see round things. &nbsp;They looked like the red-berries
  that grew all over the woods. &nbsp;He took a big bite from the side of the mound. &nbsp;It certainly was delicious.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Those red-berries inside will go very nicely with it</span><span class="c4">, he thought. &nbsp;He
  gobbled into the mound like a Termite in wood. &nbsp;He ate his way clear through to the red-berries and all the way up to the
  top of the mound where he popped out to the surface. &nbsp;He released an offensive belch that echoed from one side of the
  humming box to the other. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s living,&#39;&rdquo; he said and he plopped his over-stuffed body down on
  the quivering mound to collapse into sleep.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach had surely found his paradise. &nbsp;He could stay here forever, just eating and
  sleeping to his heart&rsquo;s content. &nbsp;But there was a problem. &nbsp;Not only was the air in the humming box cold, but it
  seemed to be disappearing. &nbsp;In all the excitement, Cockroach never noticed how hard breathing had become. And there was no
  way out.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach woke with a start, gasping for air. &nbsp;He tried to take a deep breath, but nothing
  came in. &nbsp;Frantically, he started pumping his abdomen. &nbsp;Still no air. &nbsp;He looked down at his body. &nbsp;It was
  covered with frost. &nbsp;He felt like he was back out on the soft cold. &nbsp;But out on the soft cold, at least there
  was</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">air to breathe. &nbsp;He had to get out of the humming
  box.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He tried to move off the top of the orange mound, but he was too full and too frozen to get
  anywhere. &nbsp;He was so fat, he started sinking in the mound. &nbsp;His breathing became even more difficult. &nbsp;He just
  wanted to sleep. &nbsp;He thought about Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil for the first time in a very long while. &nbsp;Then he stopped
  breathing.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly the humming box rattled and rumbled and filled with a blast of warm light; and an amazing
  thing happened. &nbsp;The entire orange mound, with Cockroach&rsquo;s limp body sinking in the center, was somehow lifted up and
  out of the humming box. &nbsp;If Cockroach had been awake, he would have found himself floating high above the black and white
  squares. &nbsp;He would have felt the quivering orange mound come to a gentle rest on a flat surface&mdash;a surface covered with
  all kinds of strange, silvery flat things, and tall, liquid-filled cylinders and other odd-looking things that had never been
  seen anywhere in Meadowfield before. &nbsp;But he missed all of this and remained limp as a wilted leaf, half-buried in the
  orange mound.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The fresh air, the quivering mound and the dreadful sounds all around him brought Cockroach back
  to his senses. &nbsp;Slowly, he opened his eyes. &nbsp;He tried to focus them, but everything was blurry. &nbsp;His body was
  still numb with cold. &nbsp;He was too groggy to understand where he was or what had happened. &nbsp;The only thing he remembered
  was the splendid belch he had expelled so eloquently inside the humming box. &nbsp;He could still hear its echo.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Probably the most amazing belch a cockroach ever produced,&rdquo; he declared with a grin.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The orange mound quivered again. &nbsp;Cockroach struggled to free himself from the orange stuff,
  but he kept sinking deeper. &nbsp;He was still having trouble seeing but he could hear. &nbsp;He could still hear those sounds.
  &nbsp;Very strange sounds.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Ahhhh, Margaret my dear, that was a meal</span><span class=
  "c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">That&rsquo;s what the sounds were like. &nbsp;But Cockroach couldn&rsquo;t begin to understand any
  of them. &nbsp;They just sounded like frightening, deep groans.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Thank you, dear. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m glad you liked
  it</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">That sound was deep too, though not as deep as the first one.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Stuffed as a tick, I am. &nbsp;Tender steak. &nbsp;And fine mashed
  potatoes</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach squirmed. &nbsp;He tried to focus his eyes again. &nbsp;Still blurry.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Well, dear, I hope you aren&rsquo;t too stuffed. &nbsp;You see that
  nice orange Jell-o mold we have for dessert, don&rsquo;t you? &nbsp;There&rsquo;s always room for Jell-o! &nbsp;And I put those
  tasty wild raspberries in it too.</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">It looks good. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t let that go
  to waste. &nbsp;Take some for yourself, Margaret, while I clear a spot on my plate</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly the orange mound really began to quiver. &nbsp;Cockroach was rocked back and forth,
  bounced up and down, lifted up and thrown down so hard he was nearly knocked senseless. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Hmmm, looks good Margaret. &nbsp;Just put mine right
  here</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach wiggled out from under a red-berry and wiped the orange stuff off his face so he could
  finally see clearly. &nbsp;The first thing he saw was an enormous shiny, silver thing dropping out of the sky. &nbsp;He ducked
  out of its way. &nbsp;The orange stuff bounced all over. &nbsp;Some of the orange stuff was carried off by the silvery
  thing.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aaaaah, Margaret. &nbsp;Before you take another mouthful, I think one of your raspberries
  just moved</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Whaaaat</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach was afraid the enormous, silvery thing would come back. &nbsp;He tried to squirm under a
  red-berry to hide.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Look closely, Margaret. &nbsp;Is that what I think it
  is</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A shadow swept over Cockroach. &nbsp;He looked up and gasped. &nbsp;Two red eyes, just cricket
  leaps away, were looming down on him. &nbsp;The eyes were surrounded by furry, gray tangles that hung down until they nearly
  touched the orange stuff. &nbsp;They were dripping with the scent of fear. &nbsp;Between the eyes, a wet mouth opened</span>
  <span class="c3">like a cave; and from somewhere, deep inside, the loudest, most horrible sound shook Cockroach to his
  core.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">YUUUEEEEEEEEEKKK</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach checked to see if his poor heart had stopped.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">AAAAUUUGGG!&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;it screamed
  again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The dreadful sounds were coming from every direction. &nbsp;Cockroach wanted to run, but where?
  &nbsp;The decision was made for him when the orange stuff suddenly went spinning across the flat surface. &nbsp;All Cockroach
  could do was hang on. &nbsp;The spinning orange stuff whizzed past the flat, silvery things and the cylinders filled with liquid,
  and continued right past the humming box. &nbsp;It slid to the very edge of the flat surface and then fell over the side.
  &nbsp;With a horrible crash, the big, round, flat thing shattered to pieces on the black and white squares. &nbsp;Cockroach was
  thrown through the air. &nbsp;He landed on the ground in a tumbling, painful heap.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Dizzy, sore, and terrified, he staggered to his feet, but the horrible sounds above him continued.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Kill it! &nbsp;Get it, Abner! &nbsp;Oh, how disgusting! &nbsp;I almost ate it! &nbsp;There
  it is. &nbsp;Over</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">there! &nbsp;Get it! &nbsp;Quick</span><span class=
  "c4">!&rdquo; &nbsp;Something smacked Cockroach&rsquo;s shell and sent him spinning like a whirligig beetle across the slippery
  ground. &nbsp;The ground started to shake. &nbsp;The same wide, flat things he had seen from below the humming box were marching
  toward him.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s still moving, Abner! &nbsp;Hit it
  again</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The loud commotion carried all the way to the yellow-light area where Grand Daddy Long-Legs was
  bouncing up and down on his eight skinny legs, rolling his eyes and sounding</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c4">the alarm.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span> <span class="c4">&ldquo;To arms! &nbsp;To arms! &nbsp;Retreat!
  &nbsp;Retreat! &nbsp;Loomers got a pest. &nbsp;Pest</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c4">down</span><span class="c2">!</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span> <span class="c2">Pest down</span><span class=
  "c4">!</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span> <span class="c4">Clear the battlefield! &nbsp;Head for the hills! &nbsp;Every pest
  for himself!&rdquo; &nbsp;And Grand Daddy Long-Legs disappeared in a crack in the ground that rose straight up to the sky
  wall.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil scrambled down from the juiceless plant as quickly as they could.
  &nbsp;The horrible sounds confused and frightened them. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wide Red-Eyes! &nbsp;That sound.</span> <span class=
  "c2">&nbsp;SNORT!</span> <span class="c4">&nbsp;That sound! &nbsp;What is that sound? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t
  panic. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t panic now</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; Acorn Weevil said to herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug had already panicked. &nbsp;Vapors exploded from her bottom in an abundance of color.
  &nbsp;She was running about in circles screaming, &ldquo;Loomers! &nbsp;Loomers! &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Loomers</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; &nbsp;The dreadful word she had always been too frightened to say.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Loomers! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Loomers</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; &nbsp;Now she couldn&rsquo;t stop
  saying it.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach was scrambling to stay ahead of the wide, flat things. &nbsp;The slippery black and
  white squares made it difficult and when one of the flat things slammed right beside him, Cockroach opened his wings and took to
  the air.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">YEEEEEEEEEK! &nbsp;GET IT!</span><span class=
  "c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach&rsquo;s belly was so full of tidbits he could barely fly. &nbsp;He managed one loop
  through the air before he crashed against a wall. &nbsp;He tried to pull his heavy body up the wall. &nbsp;He never made it.
  &nbsp;He was slapped across the back and thrown to the ground again. &nbsp;He limped desperately along the edge of the wall,
  dragging his wing to his side. &nbsp;The wide, flat things were coming toward him again. &nbsp;He was scared out of his
  shell.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Psssst. &nbsp;Psssssst. &nbsp;Over here,&rdquo; said a small voice somewhere nearby.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Over here, Brother Blattidae. &nbsp;Sanctuary is in this direction. &nbsp;Over here. &nbsp;Quick now, or
  you&rsquo;ll be nothing more than another household statistic.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.1y810tw" id="h.1y810tw"></a>Chapter 16: Book Louse</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;Over here! &nbsp;Can&rsquo;t you see me? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m
  right down here at the base of the wall,&rdquo; the tiny voice continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look down here. &nbsp;Down here, Brother
  Blattidae.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach was looking all around. &nbsp;Finally he spotted a bug-fellow sticking his head out from
  a crack in the wall. &nbsp;The bug-fellow was very tiny and his pale, round body was difficult to spot.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Good. &nbsp;Now you see me. &nbsp;It can be so difficult when you&rsquo;re small.
  &nbsp;Come on, this way. &nbsp;Follow me into the wall. &nbsp;Quickly, before it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach scurried ahead as the sounds of the wide, flat things crashed down behind him.
  &nbsp;They were coming ever closer. &nbsp;His heart was pounding away inside his battered body when he made it to the crack.
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now, Brother Blattidae. &nbsp;Into the crack.&rdquo; demanded the tiny pest.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;The wide, flat things shuffled together and stopped right beside Cockroach. &nbsp;As
  Cockroach tried to pull himself into the crack, one of the wide, flat things flew at him. Somehow it missed. &nbsp;The tiny bug
  inside the wall pulled and tugged at Cockroach&rsquo;s legs. &nbsp;The wide, flat thing struck again. &nbsp;This time, the force
  of the blow knocked the air out of Cockroach. &nbsp;Groaning with pain, he tumbled inside the crack. &nbsp;The wide, flat things
  continued to pound on the wall outside. &nbsp;The wall rumbled and shook and Cockroach was certain the entire thing would come
  crashing down around him.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Relax Brother Blattidae,&rdquo; spoke the little bug-fellow from within the darkness of the
  wall. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe in here.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Lying flat on his back, Cockroach sighed heavily. &nbsp;He closed his eyes until he finally caught
  his breath. &nbsp;Then he began to look around and study his surroundings. &nbsp;It was dark and dry inside the wall. &nbsp;The
  heavy smell of must and mold hung in the stuffy air. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Certainly a great place to hide
  out</span><span class="c4">, thought Cockroach,</span> <span class="c2">but are there any tidbits in such a dry, stuffy
  spot</span><span class="c4">?</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe,&rdquo; said the pest, as he hopped on Cockroach&rsquo;s chest, quite
  unexpectedly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Perfectly safe, at least until the Loomers bring out the sparkle dust. &nbsp;Then it becomes</span>
  <span class="c2">most</span> <span class="c4">uncomfortable for all of us!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Loomers!&rdquo; exclaimed Cockroach. &nbsp;He jumped up, sending the pale, fat-bodied
  bug-fellow sprawling. &nbsp;&ldquo;Did you say Loomers?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, Loomers. &nbsp;Of course I said Loomers,&rdquo; the tiny bug-fellow answered, picking
  himself up and dusting off.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Loomers. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what those things are out there?&rdquo; said Cockroach pointing
  toward the wall.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Of course. &nbsp;What did you</span> <span class="c2">think</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;they were? &nbsp;Overgrown ants?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Then it</span> <span class="c2">is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;true. &nbsp;All the rumors.
  &nbsp;The Loomer rumors</span> <span class="c2">are</span> <span class="c4">true.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re real,&rdquo; the pest interrupted. &nbsp;&ldquo;But if you want to go out
  there just to make sure, prove a point or something, go ahead.&rdquo; &nbsp;The wall shook again. &nbsp;&ldquo;However, I
  don&rsquo;t think that would be too wise, Brother Blattidae. &nbsp;They seem quite upset with you right now. &nbsp;You see,
  Loomers have a particular dislike for cockroaches. &nbsp;Not that I blame them,&rdquo; the pest chuckled under his breath.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Me</span><span class="c4">, on the other hand,&rdquo; he stopped and puffed up his chest as
  best as he could. &nbsp;&ldquo;Me, they hardly notice.&rdquo; &nbsp;The little pest chuckled again and then threw out his arms
  and bowed gracefully. &nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome to my world. &nbsp;Allow me to formally introduce myself. &nbsp;I am Book Louse.
  &nbsp;And I can speak on any topic with which you care to acquaint yourself. &nbsp;Try me. &nbsp;Go ahead. &nbsp;Pick a topic.
  &nbsp;Any subject. &nbsp;I can expound on them all. &nbsp;Why I&rsquo;ve eaten through the bookcase&rsquo;s finest literature.
  &nbsp;Digested half of Compton&rsquo;s Encyclopedia. &nbsp;Just finished</span> <span class="c2">Lord of the
  Flies</span><span class="c4">; I guess I&rsquo;m just a sucker for a catchy title. &nbsp;Had my eyes on another title
  too&mdash;</span><span class="c2">Cricket in Times Square</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;But that one belongs to young Ashley and
  I&rsquo;ve vowed not to eat the pages in any of</span> <span class="c2">her</span> <span class="c4">books; although her bindings
  are the sweetest on the shelf. &nbsp;But, that&rsquo;s enough about me. &nbsp;Tell me about yourself, Brother Blattidae.
  &nbsp;Chewed through any good books lately?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Listen booker-bug, or whoever you are. &nbsp;I have no idea</span> <span class=
  "c2">what</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;you&rsquo;re babbling about!&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach was obviously returning to his ornery
  old self. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking in circles! &nbsp;Books! &nbsp;Cases! &nbsp;En-cy-clop-something or other.
  &nbsp;You&rsquo;re making no sense at all! &nbsp;And</span> <span class="c2">stop</span> <span class="c4">calling me that</span>
  <span class="c2">name</span><span class="c4">, that brother what-ever-thing you keep calling me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Brother Blattidae?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes! &nbsp;Stop calling me that.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh my goodness. &nbsp;That shouldn&rsquo;t offend you. &nbsp;Why that&rsquo;s your Latin
  family name. &nbsp;Right out of</span> <span class="c2">Systema Naturae</span><span class="c4">, the book that describes
  you.&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach was not amused. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem, Brother Blattidae?&rdquo; &nbsp;Book Louse
  questioned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe me? &nbsp;Hey, look it up.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c40 c41">&#10087;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c40 c41">&#10087;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c40 c41">&#10087;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c40 c41">&#10087;</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c10"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Meanwhile, over at the yellow-light area, Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil were huddling together.
  &nbsp;The sounds ahead of them had died out. &nbsp;Overhead, Grand Daddy Long-Legs was scurrying across the wall that hung in the
  air where the sky should have been, tiptoeing along on his skinny legs and muttering to himself. &nbsp;He stopped, swiveled his
  head back, and announced, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Troops</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Stand ready! &nbsp;Full alert!
  &nbsp;Heading into enemy territory.&rdquo; &nbsp;And he disappeared around a corner. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t long before he
  reappeared, galloping along the ground toward Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Attention! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Stand to</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; he
  shouted. &nbsp;&ldquo;Scouting report from the front. &nbsp;No Loomers reported in the area. &nbsp;Troops, off alert. &nbsp;As
  you were, soldier.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone?&rdquo; asked Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class=
  "c2">Snort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Where are they? &nbsp;Where&rsquo;d they go?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Where did</span> <span class="c2">who</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;go?&rdquo; answered
  Grand Daddy Long-Legs.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Acorn Weevil and Stinkbug just looked at each other and rolled their eyes.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; Grand Daddy Long-Legs continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;More reports from the
  front. &nbsp;Your Not So Fancy friend is up in the wall with the Book Louse, just ahead. &nbsp;Where the black and white squares
  cover the ground. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the roach that&rsquo;s caused the entire hubbub. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the latest word.&rdquo;
  &nbsp;Then Grand Daddy Long-Legs turned and scampered off into the shadows once again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Inside the wall, the little Book Louse was still rambling on; he was carrying on a one-way
  conversation that leaped from one topic to another, from biographies to biology, Bach to Borneo, Houdini to who-done-its.
  &nbsp;And Cockroach never understood a word of it. &nbsp;&ldquo;Did you know there is a desert in a place called Chile where it
  has never rained? &nbsp;Never rained a drop! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Never</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Hey, don&rsquo;t
  believe me? &nbsp;Look it up! &nbsp;And speaking of biological clocks, do you realize that many of our most basic behaviors can
  actually be explained by...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Mercifully, Book Louse&rsquo;s lengthy discourse was interrupted by a voice outside the wall.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;Cockroach! &nbsp;Where are you? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s us, your fellow travelers. &nbsp;Stinkbug and
  Acorn Weevil!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You came here with someone else?&rdquo; asked Book Louse turning to Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;Not me. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know who they are or what they are talking
  about.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach!&rdquo; the voices called again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you here? &nbsp;Are you all
  right?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;They seem to know you, Brother Blattidae. &nbsp;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you came with
  other guests?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Oh well, they&rsquo;re not guests. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re not anybody, really. &nbsp;Just two pests
  that invited themselves along. &nbsp;We don&#39;t need to answer them. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t need to know I&rsquo;m
  here.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, Brother Blattidae. &nbsp;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we answer
  them?&rdquo; &nbsp;And Book Louse hoisted himself up to the crack in the wall and stuck his head through to the other side.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Here! &nbsp;Over here!&rdquo; he called to the bug-fellows out on the black and white squares. &nbsp;&ldquo;Over
  here. &nbsp;Your friend Cockroach is here with me in the wall.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">No sooner had Book Louse caught their attention than the ground began to shutter and quake.
  &nbsp;The wall started shaking too. &nbsp;It shook Book Louse from the crack and he tumbled onto the black and white
  squares.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Uh oh,&rdquo; gasped Book Louse. &nbsp;He knew something terrible was about to happen.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; he called out to Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get out of there! &nbsp;Fast!&rdquo; &nbsp;He
  backed up against the wall and looked down toward the far end of the black and white squares, where the wall began. &nbsp;Coming
  out of the cracks and crevices and spilling out onto the black and white squares was a mounting swarm of bug-fellows of every
  shape and size. &nbsp;They were leaping, flying and scrambling ahead, all with horrified looks on their faces. &nbsp;Terrified
  looks. &nbsp;And leading the charge, racing overhead on the sky wall was Grand Daddy Long-Legs, barking out commands.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">To arms! &nbsp;To arms! &nbsp;Evacuate the area! &nbsp;This is not a test. &nbsp;This is the
  real McCoy! &nbsp;Run for your lives. &nbsp;Run for your lives!</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; &nbsp;And under his breath he
  muttered, &ldquo;And if you see the Cockroach that started this whole thing, give him the quick heave-ho.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil were too stunned and surprised to move out of the way of the charging
  bug-fellows. &nbsp;They were swallowed up in the swarm of terrified pests and were nearly carried off in the onrushing crowd.
  &nbsp;Buried in the confusion, Acorn Weevil was spinning in circles; her enormous black eyes were bulging out of her head, her
  snout straight in the air, snorting and wheezing uncontrollably.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A miserable looking bug-fellow dropped from the crowd and fell right in front of Stinkbug.
  &nbsp;It was covered with a glowing, foul-smelling substance. &nbsp;It rolled to its back, spinning and twitching. &nbsp;Stinkbug
  screamed and blew out her own foul-smelling substance.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Circling overhead, Grand Daddy Long-Legs shouted, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Mayday!
  &nbsp;Mayday! &nbsp;Pest down! &nbsp;Pest down! &nbsp;Run for your lives. Before it&rsquo;s too late!</span><span class=
  "c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Quickly! &nbsp;Quickly!&rdquo; pleaded Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get over here. &nbsp;Get to
  the wall crack. &nbsp;Hurry now! &nbsp;Hurry! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the only way out!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A fat beetle plowed into Acorn Weevil, knocking her through the crowd and all the way to the wall.
  &nbsp;Book Louse rushed to her side. &ldquo;Come on! &nbsp;Come on!&rdquo; he pleaded. &nbsp;He started tugging at Acorn
  Weevil&rsquo;s antennae. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get up! &nbsp;Get up! &nbsp;Follow me!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug was in a state of shock. &nbsp;She couldn&rsquo;t stop staring at the glowing bug-fellow,
  still lying on its back, legs stiffening, twitching on the black and white squares. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;Get away from it! &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t help the poor pest now!&rdquo; shouted Book
  Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">At the far end of the wall, where the crowd of bug-fellows had first appeared, a glowing mist was
  forming. &nbsp;It was gathering over the black and white squares and spilling forward like a great storm cloud. &nbsp;It
  swallowed everything in its path.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Sparkle dust!&rdquo; gasped Book Louse.</span></p>

  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">  

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.xlzp6q3bnsbd" id="h.xlzp6q3bnsbd"></a>Chapter 17: Attic</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;On the count of three, pull! &nbsp;Quickly!&rdquo; said
  Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;One... two... threeeee!&rdquo; &nbsp;Everyone was grabbing some part of Stinkbug&rsquo;s heavy body.
  &nbsp;They were trying to pull her into the crack in the wall. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pull! &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve almost got her in!
  &nbsp;One... two... three!&rdquo; &nbsp;And on the last count of three, Stinkbug tumbled into the wall.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Whew... snort... I thought you&rsquo;d never leave that glowing pest,
  Red-Eyes.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s be glad she did,&rdquo; said Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now hurry!
  &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got to get out of here. &nbsp;The sparkle dust is right outside. &nbsp;It can get into the cracks the same way
  we did.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So, where do we go?&rdquo; asked Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We go up,&rdquo; answered Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;Follow me. &nbsp;Quickly!&rdquo;
  &nbsp;The glowing vapors started seeping into the crack. &nbsp;The bug-fellows scrambled up the wall and into the dark, stale air
  overhead. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hurry now, but don&rsquo;t slip. &nbsp;The sparkle dust is right below us. &nbsp;Once we get where
  we&rsquo;re going, we&rsquo;ll be safe. &nbsp;The sparkle dust can&rsquo;t reach us.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse led the bug-fellows to an opening at the top of the wall. &nbsp;&ldquo;Here.
  &nbsp;We&rsquo;re all right now. &nbsp;One at a time. &nbsp;Up through this crack you go.&rdquo; &nbsp;Each bug-fellow slipped
  into the crack, with Book Louse the last to enter. &nbsp;On the other side of the crack, the bug-fellows entered a vast open
  area. &nbsp;The air was stuffy and the ground was covered with a kind of pink, fluffy fur.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Welcome to the attic,&rdquo; announced Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice. &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">What&rsquo;s an
  attic</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo; &nbsp;Acorn Weevil asked herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Attic,&rdquo; continued Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;From the French word,</span> <span class=
  "c2">attique</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;An architectural term for a low story or room directly below the roof of a house, a
  garret. &nbsp;Hey, don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo; he asked, staring at the dumbfounded bug-fellows. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look it
  up!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Snort! &nbsp;Did you understand any of that? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">No, we
  didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Not a word from the little pest&rsquo;s mouth</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is the place where Loomers store all their old things,
  forgotten things, things of the past, rarely looked upon and rarely used. &nbsp;Loomers seldom pass this way and for now, neither
  will their sparkle dust.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This sparkle dust... I&rsquo;m not altogether sure what it is,&rdquo; said
  Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Snort! &nbsp;Yes! &nbsp;Glad you asked, Red-Eyes. &nbsp;We were wondering that
  myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh my. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve never seen sparkle dust before? &nbsp;You mean, you don&rsquo;t
  have sparkle dust where you come from?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;And not smarty, know-it-all book-pests either,&rdquo; grumbled Cockroach under
  his breath.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, Stinkbug, or as I would prefer to address you, Ms. Pentatomidae&mdash;your formal
  Latin name, of course&mdash;you do remember the poor, twitching bug-fellow out on the black and white squares?&rdquo;
  &nbsp;Stinkbug cringed at the thought. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, he was &lsquo;dusted.&rsquo; &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what sparkle dust does
  to a pest&rsquo;s nerves. &nbsp;Makes them go every which way but the right way. &nbsp;Then everything stops working all
  together. &nbsp;A miserable way to go.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re safe... gulp... here?&rdquo; asked Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh yes, for now that is. &nbsp;But let me warn you in advance. &nbsp;When the Great Cold is
  over and all the bug-fellows begin to multiply, well, then it&rsquo;s a different story.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Snort! &nbsp;Different?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s when the Loomers make bug-fellows really twitch. &nbsp;They spread
  sparkle dust everywhere. &nbsp;Even here in the attic, clouds of sparkle dust fill every corner. &nbsp;Every nook and cranny of
  the house.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;House? &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;What&rsquo;s a</span> <span class="c2">house</span><span class=
  "c4">?&rdquo; interrupted Acorn Weevil.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh my. &nbsp;Where</span> <span class="c2">do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;you come
  from?&rdquo; remarked Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">This</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the
  house.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Snort! &nbsp;I thought you said this was the attic</span><span class="c2">? &nbsp;Yes, he
  did. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what the Pale Belly said. &nbsp;I heard it too</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; Acorn Weevil said to
  herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The attic is</span> <span class="c2">part</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of the house,&rdquo;
  continued Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s under the roof. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s something all Loomer houses come with.
  &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo; He waited a moment for Acorn Weevil&rsquo;s reaction. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look it up! &nbsp;Now
  back to the sparkle dust. &nbsp;What I was about to suggest was, all of you</span> <span class="c2">must</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;leave before the end of the Great Cold. &nbsp;Especially you, Brother Blattidae. &nbsp;The sparkle dust formula is
  designed with you in mind. &nbsp;Dichlorophenol methyl carbamide or some such stuff even I can&rsquo;t pronounce.
  &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll tie up your antennae and twist up your belly, Brother Blattidae. &nbsp;You won&rsquo;t simply end up like Grand
  Daddy Long-Legs, with a few brain cells out of place, oh no. &nbsp;Far worse than that! &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be spinning and
  twitching from one end of the house to the other. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t be much better for the two of you,
  either,&rdquo; he turned to Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;Loomers aren&rsquo;t too fond of Pentatoms and Curculios
  either!&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil exchanged a fearful look. &nbsp;&ldquo;Until the sparkle dust loses its power,
  this is the best place for the three of you, right here in the attic. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going back down and I&rsquo;ll come back
  for you when it&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Where are you going? &nbsp;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of the sparkle dust?&rdquo; asked
  Stinkbug. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m safe unless I take a direct hit. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve inherited a bit of an
  immunity to the dust.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;An im... u... mut... Snort! &nbsp;What&rsquo;s it called?&rdquo; asked Acorn
  Weevil</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Immunity. &nbsp;Biologically programmed, over many generations of inbreeding, to have
  acquired a resistance...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Why did you have to ask?&rdquo; interrupted Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;At any rate, you can look it up. &nbsp;Let me run along. &nbsp;I know some tiny wall cracks
  I can squeeze through that&rsquo;ll take me to the bookcase. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m anxious to get back to my encyclopedia and chew off
  a few more pages. &nbsp;Before all this excitement began, I was just learning about a place called the Hanging Gardens of
  Babylon. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, did you know the Hanging Gardens are one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World? &nbsp;An
  ancient wonder and</span> <span class="c2">nothing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;remains of them today, not even a twig.
  &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you find that more than just a little strange?&rdquo; &nbsp;The three bug-fellows didn&rsquo;t know what to
  say. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t believe me? &nbsp;Look it up!&rdquo; &nbsp;And Book Louse slipped into the shadows. &nbsp;He
  paused for a moment, thinking and then added, &ldquo;Oh by the way, if any of you should happen to see Sister Saccharina up here
  before I return, tell her to stay put too. &nbsp;Of course, she&rsquo;s so addicted to book binding glue, she can barely crawl
  now. &nbsp;When she first arrived here, all she could talk about were crystal cubes. &nbsp;But now she&rsquo;s stuck on glue
  instead. &nbsp;Oh. &nbsp;I made a pun. &nbsp;Stuck on glue. &nbsp;Ha! &nbsp;Ha! &nbsp;Get it?&rdquo; &nbsp;And Book Louse
  disappeared still chuckling to himself. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ha, stuck on glue. &nbsp;Ahhh,</span> <span class="c2">what</span>
  <span class="c4">a wit.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What a big mouth know-it-all!&rdquo; grumbled Cockroach after Book Louse was
  gone.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;He does seem rather knowledgeable, Cockroach,&rdquo; said Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;And did
  you hear what he said? &nbsp;Something about a Sister Saccharina? &nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t that what he called her? &nbsp;Sister
  Saccharina. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t suppose?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose what?&rdquo; growled Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I mean, Grand Daddy Long-Legs said he saw a silvery pest and we know how much Silverfish
  loved crystal cubes, just like this Sister Saccharina. &nbsp;Do you suppose it might be&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; interrupted Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re
  thinking and it isn&rsquo;t possible! &nbsp;Silverfish was blown away. &nbsp;You saw it yourself. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s gone and dead
  as a stump. &nbsp;Stop worrying about that scaly scoundrel once and for all! &nbsp;We have more important things to worry
  about!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes! &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;Like food! &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s worry about food! &nbsp;We are very
  hungry!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; said Cockroach, kicking up some of the dusty pink fluff covering the
  attic ground. &nbsp;&ldquo;Because this stuff doesn&rsquo;t look too appetizing.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t. Snort! &nbsp;We already tried some. &nbsp;It made our snout
  itch.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach burped up a humming box tidbit from somewhere deep inside his belly. &nbsp;&ldquo;You
  two go look for tidbits. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll wait here. &nbsp;Right now I&rsquo;d rather sleep than think about
  food.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard you say that before,&rdquo; remarked Stinkbug.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re</span> <span class="c2">always</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;thinking about food. &nbsp;Are you feeling
  all right?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just fine,&rdquo; Cockroach said sharply as he rubbed his bloated stomach.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just lost my appetite for now.&rdquo; &nbsp;His belly was so stuffed with tidbits it was sore to the
  touch. &nbsp;&ldquo;Must have been all the excitement.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, come on Red-Eyes. &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go see what&rsquo;s in this attic
  place.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s awfully dark, and very scary.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, it is. &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I want you to come with
  me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, go with him. &nbsp;The little gnat needs protection,&rdquo; said Cockroach.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;And we all know how brave</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are!&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach
  wanted to roll over and laugh, but his belly hurt too much.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready to explore right now. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll just wait here.
  &nbsp;Book Louse will help us find food when he gets back.&rdquo; &nbsp;Her empty belly growled and groaned. &nbsp;&ldquo;I just
  hope he comes back soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.2xcytpi" id="h.2xcytpi"></a>Chapter 18: Hunger Pains</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">It was always dark in the attic, which made it impossible to
  know when a suntime started or ended. &nbsp;It was equally impossible to know how long Book Louse had been away. But one thing
  was certain; waiting for his return had become a very wearisome ordeal.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug tried to pass the time sucking stale sap from the attic rafters. &nbsp;It tasted
  terrible, but it kept her alive. &nbsp;Acorn Weevil spent her time taking trips into the darkness of the attic. &nbsp;She roamed
  between the rafters, crawling through the fluffy pink stuff that made her itch and sneeze. The only thing she found to eat was
  damp wood mold and Termite dust. &nbsp;The mold was tasteless and the dust was so dry, it nearly choked her when she swallowed
  it. &nbsp;It certainly wasn&rsquo;t gourmet dining, but it was enough to keep her alive. &nbsp;Cockroach was the only one not
  complaining. &nbsp;He never even mentioned food; of course, he never mentioned the humming box either. &nbsp;He slept straight
  through every suntime. &nbsp;The only sound that came from him was an occasional belch. &nbsp;But, as time passed on, even
  Cockroach began to grow hungry.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;How long have we been up here?&rdquo; exclaimed Cockroach finally waking up from his long
  sleep.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Acorn Weevil choked on another mouthful of Termite dust. &nbsp;&ldquo;Snort! &nbsp;Too
  long.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What in the name of Meadowfield are you eating?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Termite dust... Snort! &nbsp;Want to try some?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re awake,&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
  been wondering when you&rsquo;d get up.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach rolled to his feet and began glancing around the attic. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m up and
  I&rsquo;m hungry! &nbsp;So where&rsquo;s that sniveling little louse? &nbsp;Is he back yet?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m afraid not, Cockroach. &nbsp;But we expect him soon.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ahhhh...</span> <span class="c2">Poooo... ey</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; &nbsp;Acorn
  Weevil blew out a big spray of termite dust from her stuffed up snout and began coughing uncontrollably.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug slapped her on the back a few times. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you okay, Acorn
  Weevil?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s</span> <span class="c2">all</span> <span class="c4">you&rsquo;ve been
  eating up here?&rdquo; said Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Termite dust?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find much, Cockroach.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, I can tell you, I didn&rsquo;t come all the way from Meadowfield to eat that stuff.
  &nbsp;If that&rsquo;s</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;there is to eat, I&rsquo;m not staying in
  this attic place any longer!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But Cockroach, don&rsquo;t you remember what Book Louse told us?&rdquo; warned Stinkbug.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Remember what he said about the sparkle dust? &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want to spend your last moments spinning and
  twitching all over the place.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Sparkle dust, Termite dust. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s</span><span class=
  "c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">the difference?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Book Louse will be back for us. &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll let us know when it&rsquo;s safe to leave
  the attic.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And what makes you so sure, Stinkbug? &nbsp;That little Louse has probably forgotten all
  about us. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s probably off someplace mumbling gibberish to himself while we sit up here like three dumb bugs and
  starve.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;All the same, Cockroach, that sparkle dust looked</span> <span class=
  "c2">very</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;unpleasant. &nbsp;It looked much more painful than starving.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;One look! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll give this attic place one good look. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m telling
  you now, if I don&rsquo;t find some respectable tidbits, I&rsquo;m out of here, sparkle dust or not!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">And with that, Cockroach turned and stomped off across the pink fluff. &nbsp;Stinkbug didn&rsquo;t
  wish to be left alone and followed behind. &nbsp;Acorn Weevil, sniffing and snorting, brought up the rear; and together, the
  three bug-fellows took an uncertain course across the pink fluff into the darkest corners of the attic.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">They wandered for what may have been two or three suntimes. &nbsp;They searched around huge,
  square-sided containers overflowing with Loomer things, but found no tidbits. &nbsp;They passed between enormous objects on
  well-pruned stumps, much like those in the yellow light area. &nbsp;Still no tidbits. &nbsp;They crept below the nests of bully
  wasps. &nbsp;They could hear the dangerous jaws grinding above them. &nbsp;They didn&rsquo;t stop to look for tidbits there.
  &nbsp;They searched on and on, but they didn&rsquo;t find a single tidbit and grew very discouraged.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This attic place is useless!&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach exclaimed. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
  down the wall. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not staying here any longer!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But Cockroach, you could be making a terrible mistake. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you think
  we...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; snorted Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;Listen. &nbsp;We hear
  something.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear a thing,&rdquo; Cockroach grumbled.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Yes, Not So Fancy. &nbsp;We can hear it again.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I heard it too,&rdquo; said Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;From over there. &nbsp;A scratching
  sound.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;A scratching,&rdquo; said Acorn Weevil.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">No... we think it sounded more like a scritchy scraping sound</span><span class=
  "c4">,&rdquo; the silly weevil argued with herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cautiously, the bug-fellows followed the sound. &nbsp;It led them to a dusty pile of flat,
  rectangular things. &nbsp;The closer to the pile they crept, the louder the scratching became.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We hear a voice!&rdquo; Acorn Weevil suddenly exclaimed. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class=
  "c2">Yes! &nbsp;Yes! &nbsp; A voice in the pile! &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;A voice in the pile! &nbsp;We hear it too</span><span class=
  "c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach crawled in close to the rectangular things. &nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t about to believe Acorn
  Weevil until he heard the voice himself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We heard it! &nbsp;Yes we did,&rdquo; insisted Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;Dig into the
  pile, Not So Fancy... if you don&rsquo;t believe me. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes! &nbsp;Dig into the pile if you
  don&rsquo;t believe us</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach crawled up the side of the first rectangular thing. &nbsp;He wrestled through the dust
  until he reached the top of the next rectangular thing. &nbsp;This one was open and filled with stacks of yellow sheets.
  &nbsp;When he scraped away the dust, row after row of scribble skin markings appeared. &nbsp;&ldquo;Scribble skin,&rdquo; gasped
  Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere.&rdquo; &nbsp;Immediately he chewed on the corner of a scribble skin
  sheet, but it was stiff and dry, nothing like the sticky, sweet scribble skins from his stinking filth pile. &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo;
  said Cockroach and he spit the tasteless tidbit out of his mouth. &nbsp;&ldquo;Nastiest scribble skin I&rsquo;ve ever tasted!
  &nbsp;That&rsquo;s it! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve had enough of this place. &nbsp;Nothing tastes good up here!&rdquo; &nbsp;He started to
  march down from the pile of flat things.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Before he made it to the bottom of the pile, he found himself face to face with the last thing he
  ever expected to see so far from home. &nbsp;&ldquo;An impossibility,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ridiculous,&rdquo; he
  insisted. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not a chance. &nbsp;Not even the slightest,&rdquo; he finally concluded. &nbsp;Yet, crawling out from
  under a yellow sheet of scribble skin, right in front of him, as if coming back from the dead, was the unmistakable silvery head,
  long antennae and tiny, little eyes of none other than...</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Silverfish?&rdquo; gasped Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.w7hc613kkdsl" id="h.w7hc613kkdsl"></a>Chapter 19: Cabinet Meeting</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Away from the stuffy attic, life among the Loomers had become a
  serious game of hide and seek: hide from the Loomers and seek out their tidbits. &nbsp;Cockroach became very skilled at this
  game. &nbsp;He spent a great deal of time scampering about on the black and white squares, picking up tidbits from under and
  around the humming box. &nbsp;Book Louse called this area the &lsquo;kitchen.&rsquo; &nbsp;Cockroach called it &lsquo;tidbit
  bliss.&rsquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug found her piece of paradise on a warm, plant-covered ledge, which Book Louse called the
  &lsquo;window sill.&#39; &nbsp;Stinkbug called it the &lsquo;plant juice jungle.&rsquo; &nbsp;Not to be outdone, Acorn Weevil
  also had her special spot. &nbsp;Book Louse had led her to a fat bag of luscious, white powder he called &lsquo;flour.&rsquo;
  &nbsp;Acorn Weevil called it &lsquo;the best thing since sliced bread&rsquo; because Book Louse explained that sliced bread is
  what flour-powder turns into.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">And so, in the comfort of their special places, the bug-fellows had grown quite content.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;But things will change,&rdquo; Book Louse warned. &nbsp;&ldquo;You may be winning the first round of hide and seek,
  but the Loomers</span> <span class="c2">will</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;have their day.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">And that day was rapidly approaching.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">From her spot on the windowsill, Stinkbug had a pleasant view of the outside world. &nbsp;She
  watched the carefree flakes of soft cold as they drifted to the ground. &nbsp;Every now and then, Beak Beasts flew into view.
  &nbsp;Shivers of excitement ran down her back as she watched them scrape and peck in the soft cold drifts. &nbsp;There was always
  something new to see.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">As the suntimes passed, Stinkbug began to notice the soft cold was no longer thick and white.
  &nbsp;There were some spots where the soft cold was gone completely and all that remained were muddy, brown patches. &nbsp;It
  felt warmer on the windowsill and the plants in the juice jungle were beginning to flower. &nbsp;Outside, Beak Beasts were
  becoming a common sight.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Things are looking different, aren&rsquo;t they Ms. Pentatomidae?&rdquo; a little voice
  called up from below the windowsill. &nbsp;It was Book Louse, appearing as no more than a speck on the floor.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been keeping a watch on the weather. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s my belief that we are witnessing the last of The
  Great Cold. &nbsp;Calculating from the Loomer calendar and the Farmer&rsquo;s Almanac, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re approaching the
  Loomer month of April. &nbsp;If my calculations are correct, and I have every reason to believe they are, plans will have to be
  made. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll notify the others. &nbsp;But, Ms. Pentatomidae, I sense you don&rsquo;t agree with me. &nbsp;Hey!
  &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t believe me? &nbsp;Look it up!&rdquo; &nbsp;And Book Louse disappeared before Stinkbug could explain that it
  wasn&#39;t that she didn&rsquo;t believe him, she just didn&rsquo;t understand anything Book Louse was talking about.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Several suntimes passed. &nbsp;Then at one suntime&rsquo;s end, when everything was dark and quiet
  across the black and white squares, a meeting was called to order. &nbsp;Book Louse met the bug-fellows beside the humming box.
  &nbsp;From there, he led them to a place he called &lsquo;the cabinet&rsquo; and after they crawled inside it he announced,
  &ldquo;Now you are all members of my cabinet!&rdquo; &nbsp;He burst into wild laughter. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joke,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Political Loomer humor.&rdquo; &nbsp;None of the others understood. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, ahem. &nbsp;Anyway,
  let&rsquo;s get started,&rdquo; said Book Louse, still chuckling quietly to himself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse climbed to the top of a tall, colorful box and began his speech. &nbsp;&ldquo;The Great
  Cold is over,&rdquo; he informed them. &nbsp;&ldquo;It is the beginning of The Warming Times. &nbsp;You know what that
  means.&rdquo; &nbsp;He went on to remind them how dangerous Loomers become in The Warming Times. &nbsp;Everyone listened very
  closely, except Cockroach, who was busy chewing on the side of the colorful box. &nbsp;&ldquo;Brother Blattidae! &nbsp;Control
  yourself!&rdquo; shouted Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cardboard you are eating!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hmmmm... it&rsquo;s not bad. &nbsp;But this stuff inside is even better. &nbsp;What are
  these crunchy things?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Fruit Loops. &nbsp;Loomer breakfast food. &nbsp;Now leave it alone and pay
  attention!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The bug-fellows had to pull Cockroach away from the colorful box. &nbsp;He sat quietly for a
  while. &nbsp;But then he spotted a black cylinder in the corner of the cabinet. &nbsp;It had a captivating smell. &nbsp;Little
  did he know it was a Loomer roach motel with a poison-filled room reserved just for him. &nbsp;It was all the bug-fellows could
  do to keep Cockroach away from the trap; in the end, Book Louse was happy to see Cockroach munch away on the Fruit Loops
  instead.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make this as brief as possible,&rdquo; started Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;My
  bug-fellow friends, you need to leave this house very soon. &nbsp;The Loomers are about to bring out their heavy
  artillery.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Schnort! &nbsp;Who are Art and Larry?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Artillery</span><span class="c4">, Cousin Curculio,&rdquo; Book
  Louse repeated. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am referring to the large scale use of sparkle dust. &nbsp;It will fill every nook and cranny in
  this house. &nbsp;Only those bug-fellows that were exposed to it in the past will survive. &nbsp;This doesn&rsquo;t include the
  three of you.</span> <span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">None</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of you could possibly
  survive!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And does that include Silverfish?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The sparkle dust will reach the attic too. &nbsp;She&rsquo;ll never
  survive.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like she&rsquo;s going to last much longer anyway,&rdquo; remarked
  Cockroach as he stuffed his mouth with another fat Fruit Loop. &nbsp;&ldquo;Did you see how awful she looks? &nbsp;Of course, she
  never looked like much anyway.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We simply</span> <span class="c2">can&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;leave her there
  to die!&rdquo; insisted Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was my fault she blew out of that tree. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself
  if we leave her now.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Eeeehhh, leave her and blame it on me then, if it will make you feel better,&rdquo;
  Cockroach mumbled through his Fruit Loop-stuffed cheeks.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think we can pull Sister Saccharina away from her book-binding
  glue,&rdquo; replied Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to break her from the awful habit, but she just digs in deeper.
  &nbsp;She simply can&rsquo;t control her craving. &nbsp;It has taken a terrible toll on her mind and body. &nbsp;Her system is so
  full of glue, I believe her brain cells are stuck together.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Humphhh... mummphhh,&rdquo; sputtered Cockroach through another mouthful of Fruit Loops.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I know. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s such a mess... mummphhh... she can barely speak.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But there must be a way!&rdquo; insisted Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;There</span> <span class=
  "c2">must</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;be!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You know, this reminds me of a problem we once had with my step-sister,&rdquo; remarked
  Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;Or was it my aunt? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Snort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Oh well, I guess
  it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp;Anyway... she just loved to play in tree sap.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your point?&rdquo; growled Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well... snort! &nbsp;We couldn&rsquo;t keep her away from the sap.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes! &nbsp;I remember, now that we mention it</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; Acorn Weevil said to
  herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">I remember it very well indeed</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug and
  Book Louse exchanged glances while Acorn Weevil continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;The tree sap made her dizzy and she was forever falling
  out of the tree. &nbsp;We just knew one of those falls would be her last. &nbsp;So naturally, we decided something had to be
  done.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Cockroach replied sarcastically.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What did you do? &nbsp;What did you do?&rdquo; asked Stinkbug, showing a sudden interest in
  the story.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Who cares,&rdquo; moaned Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Schnort! &nbsp;We decided to find something she would like even better than tree sap.
  &nbsp;Something that&rsquo;s so good, she would never go back to the tree sap again. &nbsp;Only one problem... we never found
  anything. &nbsp;And then one suntime she fell from the tree and landed so hard her snout shoved through her head... and that was
  that. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes! &nbsp;I remember! &nbsp;I remember! &nbsp;And we told the story so
  good</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So</span> <span class="c2">well</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;You told it so</span>
  <span class="c2">well</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; Book Louse corrected.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo; complained Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dumbest
  story I ever heard. &nbsp;Are you sure the sap-sucking, tree-tumbling gnat wasn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now wait a moment, Brother Blattidae,&rdquo; said Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;With the
  exception of the improper use of the language, I&rsquo;ve sensed some merit in this story. &nbsp;Cousin Curculio, are you
  suggesting we need to find something that Sister Saccharina wants even</span> <span class="c2">more</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;than her book-binding glue?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Am</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;I?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Everyone rolled their eyes at each other. &nbsp;Suddenly Stinkbug leaped up, nearly popping out of
  her shell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; she shouted. &nbsp;&ldquo;Crystal cubes!
  &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll use crystal cubes. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s it! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s it! &nbsp;She loves them!&rdquo; Stinkbug was
  delighted with herself. &nbsp;She ran around in circles, happily blowing blue vapors in every direction. &nbsp;&ldquo;Crystal
  cubes! &nbsp;It will work! &nbsp;It</span> <span class="c2">will</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;work!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You may have something there, Ms. Pentatomidae. &nbsp;But please, calm down
  first.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave a trail of crystal cubes,&rdquo; the breathless Stinkbug gasped.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;A trail from the attic, inside the wall, across the black and white squares, and finally outside, far away from this
  place. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll lead her so far away she&rsquo;ll never find her book-binding glue again!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse nodded her tiny head with approval and agreed the plan could work. &nbsp;Acorn Weevil
  offered to help any way she could. &nbsp;She was just delighted someone had a plan. &nbsp;Cockroach, on the other hand, thought
  the whole thing was a waste of time and energy, not to mention a waste of crystal cubes. &nbsp;He made no excuses for his lack of
  concern for Silverfish. &nbsp;But when Book Louse announced he knew the location of the Loomer crystal cubes, Cockroach suddenly
  became very interested. &nbsp;He could still see his own crystal cube melting on the floodwaters back in the forest.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, what are we waiting for?&rdquo; demanded Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Those crystal cubes aren&rsquo;t going to
  come to</span> <span class="c2">us</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Step this way,&rdquo; said Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;The crystal cubes are stored in an
  upper cabinet. &nbsp;But, I must warn you. &nbsp;They</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;won&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;be
  easy to get.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.qsh70q" id="h.qsh70q"></a>Chapter 20: The Lid Lifter</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; said Book Louse, staring up at the
  huge, shiny-white object on the cabinet shelf. &nbsp;The bug-fellows were high above the black and white squares where they had
  followed Book Louse to the upper cabinets. &nbsp;They all stood about gazing up at the enormous, round object in front of
  them.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This is what?&rdquo; exclaimed Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no crystal
  cube!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No Brother Blattidae, it isn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the bowl in which the Loomers keep
  their crystal cubes. &nbsp;The cubes are right inside. &nbsp;The problem is, I don&rsquo;t know how to get to them. &nbsp;The
  bowl has a heavy lid that we can&rsquo;t possibly lift off.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; sighed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll never be able to save
  Silverfish.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; asked Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yes.
  &nbsp;Yes.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span> <span class="c2">What to do? &nbsp;What</span> <span class="c2 c6">do</span>
  <span class="c2">we do</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; said Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;Give me
  some time. &nbsp;Let me run a few pages across my mind from an old physics text I recently chewed on. &nbsp;I might find an
  answer there.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I certainly...</span> <span class="c2">schnort</span><span class="c4">&hellip; &nbsp;hope
  so,&rdquo; said Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yes, me too! Me too!</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Quiet now, Acorn Weevil,&rdquo; said Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Leave Book Louse alone.
  &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll think of something, won&rsquo;t you, Book Louse?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse thought and thought for a very long time, shifting his body from one side to the other.
  &nbsp;Each time he shifted, the others leaned and shifted with him, fully expecting Book Louse to come up with a brilliant idea
  at any moment. &nbsp;At one point, when he sprang up and circled the bowl several times, the bug-fellows were certain he had the
  solution. &nbsp;But he just came back to the same spot and started thinking all over again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;How long is this going to take?&rdquo; moaned Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Shhhh. &nbsp;Quiet now,&rdquo; whispered Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see how
  hard he is working?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach muttered something under his breath and turned away. &nbsp;He crawled off and slipped
  under the cabinet door to get some fresh air. &nbsp;From the edge of the cabinet, he looked upon the &lsquo;tidbit bliss&rsquo;
  area below. &nbsp;Dusty beams of light from the new suntime flickered across the black and white squares. &nbsp;Against the far
  wall stood the humming box, whirring away like a hive of bees. &nbsp;On top of the lower cabinets, along the flat surface, a
  clear ball bubbled and filled with a black fluid.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ahoy there, mate,&rdquo; called out a voice just above Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Top o&rsquo;
  the morning to ye! &nbsp;Six bells and all that stuff. &nbsp;Great day for a war, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; &nbsp;It was
  Grand Daddy Long-Legs completing his early suntime jog across the sky wall. &nbsp;He had spotted Cockroach at the cabinet door
  and was starting to head down toward him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good to see you out so early, soldier. &nbsp;Standing ready. &nbsp;On the
  alert, always the best defense! &nbsp;Capture the high ground first. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what I always preach. &nbsp;Keep your
  position, pest. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re serving your commanders well. &nbsp;Keep it up and there might be a promotion ahead, know what
  I mean? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not beyond putting a good word in for a soldier who does his job.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach didn&rsquo;t know what to make of the eight-legged creature angling toward him. &nbsp;He
  had seen him once before, but that was at a safe distance. &nbsp;The creature had all the features of a dreaded Web-Spinner,
  although thinner perhaps, but Web-Spinner-like all the same.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Spot any Loomers lately?&rdquo; asked Grand Daddy Long-Legs as he wrapped two spindly legs
  around the top of the cabinet door and peered down on Cockroach with his two stalked eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;I trust your battalion is
  fully prepared for battle?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly, out of the silence, a deep groan echoed across the black and white squares. &nbsp;It
  startled both Cockroach and Grand Daddy Long-Legs. &nbsp;Cockroach scampered back inside the cabinet. &nbsp;Grand Daddy Long-Legs
  followed right behind.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Whaaa-what was that noise?&rdquo; said Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Grand Daddy Long-Legs didn&rsquo;t answer. &nbsp;He spotted the other bug-fellows and raced to the
  upper corner of the cabinet and started barking out commands. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">To arms! &nbsp;To arms!
  &nbsp;Man your battle stations! &nbsp;Fight the bloody battle till the last enemy falls!</span><span class=
  "c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Relax commander,&rdquo; said Book Louse looking up at Grand Daddy Long-Legs.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;There are no enemies here. &nbsp;Just Ms. Pentatomidae, Cousin Curculio, Brother Blattidae and myself. &nbsp;No
  threat to anyone. &nbsp;Just four pests trying to figure out how to lift the lid on this bowl of crystal cubes.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ho! &nbsp;Ho! &nbsp;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo; bellowed Grand Daddy Long-Legs.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old lid lifter from way back. &nbsp;At ease troops, as you were. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll have this lid off in
  no time at all. &nbsp;Now</span> <span class="c2">what</span> <span class="c4">did you say was inside it?&rdquo; &nbsp;Grand
  Daddy Long-Legs dropped down and landed on the bowl with a hard thud. &nbsp;He circled the lid several times. &nbsp;Finally he
  stopped and looked over the edge. &nbsp;He peered down at the four bug-fellows below. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class=
  "c2">What</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;am I doing up here?&rdquo; he asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have completely
  forgotten.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You said you could remove the lid off the bowl,&rdquo; replied Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This lid?&rdquo; Grand Daddy Long-Legs gasped. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class=
  "c2">This</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;lid? &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never lifted a lid in my life. &nbsp;Especially one of this
  size.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh for goodness&rsquo; sakes, try anyway,&rdquo; pleaded Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;You just
  told us you could.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Very well. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll try. &nbsp;Never one to shy away from a
  challenge.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Grand Daddy Long-Legs flattened his body across the lid. &nbsp;Moving ever so slowly, he felt
  along the edge of the lid, probing every chip and curve along the surface, straightening his legs one at a time. &nbsp;When the
  tips of each leg had secured a grip, he began to heave his skinny body upward. &nbsp;He heaved up and he heaved down, again and
  again. &nbsp;He pulled and tugged and pulled some more while the excited bug-fellows shouted up words of encouragement. &nbsp;The
  lid began to rattle as if it were about to come loose, but each time it fell back in place with a ringing clink.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Come on! &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve almost got it!&rdquo; cheered Acorn Weevil.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Pull. &nbsp;Pull!&rdquo; chanted Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Harder! &nbsp;Harder!&rdquo; shouted Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Give it up!&rdquo; growled Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The exhausted Grand Daddy Long-Legs stopped a moment to catch his breath. &nbsp;He was about to
  give it one last try, when suddenly the cabinet door swung open. &nbsp;Everyone gasped at the same time.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Head for cover! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Quick</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; shouted
  Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The bug-fellows scattered in all directions. &nbsp;Book Louse wiggled into a crack in the cabinet
  shelf. &nbsp;Cockroach scurried between a pair of shiny cylinders and Acorn Weevil hid in the purple fumes pouring out of
  Stinkbug&rsquo;s trembling body. &nbsp;Grand Daddy Long-Legs pressed himself against the bowl. &nbsp;Ever so slowly, he lowered
  himself down the side of the bowl. &nbsp;Just as he was about to drop to the shelf, the bowl of crystal cubes was lifted up and
  whisked away through the cabinet doors.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; gasped an astonished Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t see a thing,&rdquo; choked Acorn Weevil emerging from Stinkbug&rsquo;s
  putrid, purple cloud.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse raced to the edge of the cabinet door. &nbsp;The others followed and crowded around
  him.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Shnort</span><span class="c4">!
  &nbsp;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The Loomers have taken the bowl,&rdquo; Book Louse said gravely. &nbsp;&ldquo;And the old
  commander too. &nbsp;Look down there,&rdquo; he pointed toward the humming box.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The bowl had been placed on the flat surface near the bubbling, black liquid. &nbsp;Grand Daddy
  Long-Legs, who had hung on for dear life, was just crawling down from the side of the bowl. &nbsp;He looked up at the others, who
  were huddled together at the door of the cabinet, and gave them a standing salute. &nbsp;He started to wander out from the
  shadows of the bowl when a shaggy-haired Loomer striding across the black and white squares suddenly appeared. &nbsp;Grand Daddy
  Long-Legs ducked behind the bowl and pressed himself into a tight, little ball, hoping he wouldn&rsquo;t be seen. The horrible
  Loomer walked right up to the bowl, removed the lid, reached in, and picked out a glistening, white crystal cube.
  &nbsp;Triumphantly, it held the cube high in the air. &nbsp;Of course, this made Cockroach</span> <span class="c2">very</span>
  <span class="c4">excited.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Look! &nbsp;Look! &nbsp;A cube!&rdquo; shouted Cockroach barely able to contain himself.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;A magnificent crystal cube! &nbsp;Look at it! &nbsp;Just look at it!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Brother Blattidae, calm down. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re about to fall out of the
  cabinet.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Grand Daddy Long-Legs decided to find a safer place to hide and when the Loomer turned to drop the
  crystal cube into a steaming cup of black liquid, Grand Daddy Long-Legs made his move. &nbsp;He looked up at the four
  bug-fellows, saluted, scrambled to the top of the bowl, saluted yet again, and jumped in with the crystal cubes.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; screeched Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Who knows!&rdquo; said Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Feeling safe and secure, Grand Daddy Long-Legs stretched his skinny legs from one side of the bowl
  to the other. &nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t see the Loomer, so he assumed the Loomer couldn&rsquo;t see him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo;
  he remarked, licking the crystal cubes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not too bad. &nbsp;Not bad at all. &nbsp;Reminds me of the taste
  of...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">His thoughts were suddenly interrupted. &nbsp;The Loomer had returned for another crystal cube.
  &nbsp;It reached into the bowl. &nbsp;It touched Grand Daddy Long-Legs quivering body and two of his skinny legs. &nbsp;Grand
  Daddy Long-Legs looked up. &nbsp;All he could see was a pair of Loomer eyes staring, red and hard, directly down at him.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire till you see the whites of their eyes!&rdquo; he shouted.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yeeee...Yeeeeeeeeeek</span><span class="c4">!</span><span class=
  "c2">&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;screamed the Loomer.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Grand Daddy Long-Legs charged out of the bowl and up the Loomer. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Everything</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;went flying. &nbsp;The bowl of crystal cubes spun away in one direction and Grand
  Daddy Long-Legs was hurled off in another. &nbsp;He landed on the black and white squares with a hard thump.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;To arms! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">To arms</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; he groaned
  as he staggered to his feet. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">The enemy is engaged.</span> <span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Take your battle stations! &nbsp;Every pest for himself!</span><span class=
  "c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">With a whistling rush of air followed by a terrible crash, pieces of white bowl exploded across
  the black and white squares. &nbsp;The air filled with fragments of crystal cubes, twinkling like the lights over Meadowfield on
  a crisp suntime&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;The shower of crystal fragments fell to the squares, spread to the wall, and slid under the
  humming box.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Grand Daddy Long-Legs took a quick look around. &nbsp;&ldquo;Too much commotion so early in one
  suntime,&rdquo; he muttered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Time to retreat.&rdquo; &nbsp;Off he sped as quickly as his eight, skinny legs would
  carry him.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better hide too,&rdquo; warned Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;Time to get out of the
  cabinet. &nbsp;The Loomers will want to know where the commander came from and this cabinet is bound to be the first place
  they&rsquo;ll look.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re right behind you,&rdquo; said Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Lead the
  way.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The bug-fellows hurried down the cabinet. &nbsp;All around them the Loomer wailed.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s it! &nbsp;That is it, Abner! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll have no more nasty bugs in my
  kitchen. &nbsp;Do you hear me! &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got to spray the house! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s got to be sprayed this
  weekend</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">As the four bug-fellows raced to safety inside the wall, Cockroach kept looking back to the space
  below the humming box. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t know if the others had seen the crystal cubes slide under there, but</span>
  <span class="c2">he</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;certainly did. &nbsp;And he wasn&rsquo;t about to tell anyone.</span></p>

  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.3as4poj" id="h.3as4poj"></a>Chapter 21: Escape Plan</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">After the spilling of the crystal cubes, Book Louse instructed
  everyone to stay hidden inside the wall. &nbsp;It was no longer safe to move about in the Loomer areas. &nbsp;Things were
  becoming too dangerous and Loomer movement was increasing. &nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re planning something dreadful,&rdquo; warned
  Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;I just</span> <span class="c2">know</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;they are.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">One mid-suntime, not long after the bug-fellows had gone into hiding, Book Louse decided to go on
  a scouting mission outside the wall. &nbsp;He told the others not to worry about him. &nbsp;The Loomers would never see him.
  &nbsp;He would stay in the shadows along the wall. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d never be noticed. &nbsp;Loomers rarely bother with book lice
  anyway. &nbsp;He would be back by suntime&rsquo;s end with a full report.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse kept his word. &nbsp;He returned late into suntime&rsquo;s end, when everything was
  dark and still, and the only sounds were the invisible wood-creakers and the moaning of the humming box. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wake up
  everyone. &nbsp;Get up!&rdquo; he exclaimed bursting into the wall. &nbsp;He was in an unusual state of panic.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the sparkle dust! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen it!&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil woke up quickly.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Sparkle dust, and lots of it! &nbsp;It&#39;s in the Loomer storeroom. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t there before, but it is
  now! &nbsp;Things are developing faster than I expected. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no time to waste. &nbsp;We must go! &nbsp;Right now!
  &nbsp;Get Brother Blattidae up and let&rsquo;s get moving!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; said Stinkbug blearily.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do you mean he&rsquo;s not here? &nbsp;Where is he?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We thought he was...</span> <span class="c2">SNORT</span><span class="c4">&hellip; with
  you.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;With me? &nbsp;Why would he be with me? &nbsp;He never went with me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well then, where is he?&rdquo; said Stinkbug in a worried voice.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I have no idea! &nbsp;No idea at all! &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know</span> <span class=
  "c2">where</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;he is!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We have to find him!&rdquo; said Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;There simply isn&rsquo;t any time.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But, now Cockroach and Silverfish are both...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Ms. Pentatomidae. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t understand. &nbsp;I have
  never,</span> <span class="c2">never</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in my entire life, seen such a stockpile of sparkle dust.
  &nbsp;Cylinder after cylinder, vat after vat. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s enough sparkle dust in that storeroom to blast us all the way
  back to the Carboniferous Age!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Schnort!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; Is that anywhere near my oak
  tree?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse ignored Acorn Weevil&rsquo;s comment. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think</span>
  <span class="c2">I</span> <span class="c4">could even survive if the Loomers decide to use</span> <span class=
  "c2">all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the sparkle dust I&rsquo;ve just seen.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave without Silverfish,&rdquo; Stinkbug declared. &nbsp;&ldquo;And although
  he may not seem worth the bother, I won&rsquo;t leave without Cockroach either.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We simply don&rsquo;t have the time to look for them. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve already made
  arrangements for your escape. &nbsp;The plan is in place and in motion. &nbsp;There is</span><span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">no</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;room for error!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;SCHNORT! &nbsp;A plan! &nbsp;A plan! &nbsp;Finally a plan! &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Yes! &nbsp;Yes! &nbsp;The Pale Belly has a plan! &nbsp;Should we ask him to explain it?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; No...
  SCHNORT... Why bother? &nbsp;What difference does it make? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">plan</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Any plan is better than none at all!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ms. Pentatomidae! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll not argue further. &nbsp;If we don&rsquo;t move now,
  while it is dark and the Loomers are still asleep, it will be too late for</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">all</span> <span class="c4">of us!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yes!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; Listen. &nbsp;SCHNORT!
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">You stubborn old Red-Eyes!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a plan!
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes, it is. &nbsp;You are right. &nbsp;A wonderful plan indeed!</span><span class=
  "c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Reluctantly, Stinkbug listened, but she was not happy with the situation at all.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now, you have a long trip ahead of you. &nbsp;You will need provisions.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Provisions!&rdquo; shouted Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;SCHNORT! &nbsp;Yes... of course...
  we</span> <span class="c2">will need</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;those provisions...</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;What&rsquo;s a
  provisions</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Food, Cousin Curculio, and a method of transport. &nbsp;These are the provisions I&rsquo;m
  speaking of.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I knew that,&rdquo; answered the excited Acorn Weevil.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had your escape route mapped out for some time.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Mapped? &nbsp;Mapped&hellip;,&rdquo; said Acorn Weevil letting the word roll slowly off her
  tongue. &nbsp;&ldquo;We like that word...</span> <span class="c2">mapped</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ashley has been a tremendous help.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ashley!&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;The one with the sweet bindings you told us
  about? &nbsp;You</span> <span class="c2">did</span> <span class="c4">say Ashley?</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain later,&rdquo; said Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But, Ashley... isn&rsquo;t she a Loo-Loom...&rdquo; Stinkbug couldn&rsquo;t say the word
  and started to tremble. &nbsp;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a Loo...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;A Loomer,&rdquo; Book Louse answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, she is a Loomer. &nbsp;But not like
  the others, trust me. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s not the same.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yes. &nbsp;Not like the others</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo;
  interrupted Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pale Belly knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. &nbsp;And if you don&rsquo;t believe him?
  &nbsp;Well... just look it up! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Isn&rsquo;t that right Pale Belly bug</span><span class=
  "c4">?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Beyond the lawn, at the edge of the stream, there is a boat anchored in the marshes and
  waiting for us at this very moment,&rdquo; continued Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;A boat! &nbsp;I knew it! &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;A</span> <span class=
  "c2">beautiful</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;boat! &nbsp;Waiting</span> <span class="c2">just</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for
  us...</span> <span class="c2">What&rsquo;s a boat</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Leaping Leafhoppers, Acorn Weevil,&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Calm
  down!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;There is food, packed on board,&rdquo; explained Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;But we will need
  to gather more. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t plan on such a premature departure. &nbsp;Our easiest access to food is under the humming
  box. &nbsp;Loomers are forever dropping tidbits under there. &nbsp;We should find all we need. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll transfer as many
  loads to the boat as we can. &nbsp;But we must work fast,</span> <span class="c2">before</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the Loomers
  wake up. &nbsp;Quickly now, follow me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Hidden under the cover of darkness, the three bug-fellows crawled out from the wall. &nbsp;Book
  Louse lead the way, followed by Acorn Weevil and finally Stinkbug, who was still trying to deal with the possibility of leaving
  poor Silverfish and Cockroach behind. &nbsp;She argued it back and forth in her tiny, troubled mind. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can never
  leave them,&rdquo; she muttered, as she crawled across the cold, black and white squares. &nbsp;&ldquo;But what else</span>
  <span class="c2">can</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I do? &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t save them!&rdquo; &nbsp;Then she thought about how
  she would feel if she didn&rsquo;t at least try. &nbsp;Her poor brain ached with the weight of the decision.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along with this plan, for a while. &nbsp;But then, but then</span> <span class=
  "c2">what</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo; she thought.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Before she knew it, she and the rest of the tidbit gathering party had arrived at the base of the
  humming box. &nbsp;The towering box rose before them like a massive tree, stretching up into the darkness. &nbsp;The bug-fellows
  could feel its powerful rumblings beneath their feet. &nbsp;It moaned and groaned like an angry Long Horn.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Are we ready?&rdquo; asked Book Louse, and when no one answered, he went ahead and crawled
  into the dark space below the box. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil exchanged a worried look. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully scary looking
  under there,&rdquo; said Stinkbug.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Come on. &nbsp;Come on. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing to worry about,&rdquo; said Book Louse
  poking his tiny head out from the darkness. &nbsp;&ldquo;There are all kinds of interesting tidbits here.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cautiously, Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil moved ahead and worked their way under the humming box.
  &nbsp;Soon they were scraping up sweet, sticky substances and moldy residues from the dark, damp areas.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;Stinkbug was the largest in the group and she was elected to carry the scraped up tidbits on
  her back. &nbsp;Book Louse and Acorn Weevil piled mounds and mounds of it across her shell. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t long before she
  was packed up with all she could hold. &nbsp;Straining with the weight of the load, she wiggled and squirmed out from under the
  humming box.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Thif vay,&rdquo; mumbled Book Louse through a wad of scribble skin he had tucked away in
  his mouth. &nbsp;He led them under a crack in the wall and out to a dew-covered lawn. &nbsp;The air was cool and refreshing; the
  young grass seedlings soft and sweet. &nbsp;The fresh air made Stinkbug wish she could just open her wings and fly madly through
  the trees, but she could barely move with the load of tidbits she had on her back. &nbsp;Every now and then, she stopped to suck
  up the delicious juices from the tender grass seedlings all around her. &nbsp;Never had grass juice tasted so good.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hurry Ms. Pentatomidae,&rdquo; said Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;We still have more trips to
  make.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug plodded on, pressing the young grass blades beneath her heavy shell. &nbsp;The grass
  seedlings were a larger obstacle for the tiny Book Louse. &nbsp;He was constantly disappearing in their shadows. &nbsp;Acorn
  Weevil moved slowly and steadily, dragging a trophy-sized lump of hardened flour. &nbsp;In the darkness ahead, the sound of water
  could be heard.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Just a little farther to the boat,&rdquo; announced Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Glad to hear that,&rdquo; said Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  exhausted.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse led the bug-fellows to the edge of a stream. &nbsp;They followed him out across a
  slippery branch. &nbsp;They could hear the sound of water lapping in the darkness just below them and they could feel its icy
  spray. &nbsp;The end of the branch angled down toward the stream. &nbsp;Just ahead, the tip of the branch disappeared into the
  water. &nbsp;Appearing in the darkness, a large object floated and bobbed in the stream.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ashley&rsquo;s boat!&rdquo; exclaimed Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;A fine hull, molded from
  unsinkable plastic. &nbsp;Powered by a pair of nine-volt batteries, charged and ready. &nbsp;A twelve-inch beam, with plenty of
  room on board. &nbsp;Quality construction manufactured by the Tony Toy Company of Tampa. &nbsp;Hey, don&rsquo;t believe me?
  &nbsp;Look it up! &nbsp;Says so right on the starboard side.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">In the darkness, it was difficult to see what this so-called &lsquo;boat&rsquo; even looked like.
  &nbsp;Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil just wanted to unload their heavy cargo. &nbsp;They quickly followed Book Louse
  aboard.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the ship&rsquo;s tour later and I&rsquo;ll introduce you to our
  captain. &nbsp;But first, we need to load more provisions before suntime arrives. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s head back. &nbsp;There
  is</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;no</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">time to waste.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Once free of their heavy loads, the trip back to the black and white squares took no time at all.
  The three pests were soon scraping up tidbits once again from under the humming box. &nbsp;Stinkbug was tugging at a stubborn
  pile of sticky slime, when she heard a scratching sound that seemed to come from somewhere near the back of the humming box.
  &nbsp;There was something moving about in the shadows. &nbsp;The others heard it too. &nbsp;The thought of a Web-Spinner or bully
  wasp lurking in the shadows entered everyone&rsquo;s mind.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;Book Louse. &nbsp;Do any Web-Spinners or Dagger-Tails live in these
  areas?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Snort! &nbsp;Yes, Pale Belly! &nbsp;Do they? &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Schnort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;Flat-Bodied Claw-Legged Dagger-Tails! &nbsp;They&rsquo;re the worst... or how about
  bully wasps? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Oh no! &nbsp;Did we say bully wasps?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span> <span class=
  "c2">Snort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s a scary thought too</span><span class="c4">?
  &nbsp;Any of those around here?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;None that I know of, Cousin Curculio. &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s not often that I find myself
  rummaging about below the humming box.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;D-d-do you th-think maybe we&rsquo;ve loaded enough for now?&rdquo; asked Stinkbug in a
  quivering voice. &nbsp;No one answered. &nbsp;Stinkbug felt a puff of vapor pass from her perfumery. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo;
  she cried. &nbsp;&ldquo;I see something moving, right over there.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Snort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;We see it too.
  &nbsp;Just over there.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug&rsquo;s body began to shake uncontrollably. &nbsp;She wheeled around and tucked her face
  into her chest. Then, with her bottom high in the air, she blew out a concentrated cloud of green and yellow vapor. &nbsp;It
  poured to the back of the humming box. &nbsp;It even glowed in the dark.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cricket kickin&rsquo; katydids!&rdquo; exclaimed Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;That ought to
  get him, Wide Red-Eyes! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes it should. &nbsp;Snort! &nbsp;You are right about
  that</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; she babbled to herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">From the depths of the glowing, green cloud, a choking and coughing sound could be heard.
  &nbsp;Something was there. &nbsp;It was scratching about, from one side of the humming box to the other. &nbsp;Finally it burst
  from the cloud, spitting and sputtering and shouting off an endless string of insults. &nbsp;&ldquo;You stinking grub-faced
  maggot,&rdquo; it squealed. &nbsp;&ldquo;You big ball of slime! &nbsp;Stinkbug, I&rsquo;ll get you for this! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll
  wrap that gas-blasting bottom around your neck until your head turns purple and pops off like a fat wad of grasshopper
  spit!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was Cockroach. &nbsp;There was no mistaking it.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cockroach! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m</span>
  <span class="c2">so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;glad we found you! &nbsp;You really had me worried. &nbsp;So</span> <span class=
  "c2">this</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is where you&rsquo;ve been hiding out?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, it certainly looks that way, Ms. Pentatomidae,&rdquo; remarked Book Louse.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;And, Brother Blattidae, if I might add, it appears that you&rsquo;ve been enjoying the spoils of the crystal cube
  accident.&rdquo; &nbsp;He pointed to a pile of shiny crystals in the far corner of the humming box. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  quite a collection you have packed away.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Those are</span> <span class="c2">my</span> <span class="c4">crystal cubes!&rdquo; warned
  Cockroach rubbing the last of the stinging vapor from his eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;I found them first and I&rsquo;ve piled them here
  for</span> <span class="c2">my</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;safe keeping!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, Brother Blattidae, there is nothing safe around here anymore. &nbsp;You&rsquo;d
  better pack up what you can of your precious cubes and follow us to safety. &nbsp;The Loomers are about to unleash the deadliest
  sparkle dust these old walls have ever seen!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The Pale Belly is right, Not So Fancy. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s seen it himself.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Schnort! &nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Lots and lots of the spark-ally stuff. &nbsp;But we have a
  boat-thing and everything. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s all planned out. &nbsp;A real</span> <span class="c2">plan</span><span class=
  "c4">!</span> <span class="c2">&nbsp;Yes. Yes. &nbsp;A real plan indeed</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;My plan is to stay right here with my crystal cubes,&rdquo; growled Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This is not a time to be stubborn,&rdquo; Stinkbug reasoned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Your crystal
  cubes will be of no use to you if you&rsquo;re spinning and twitching with sparkle dust.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;And if you don&rsquo;t go now, you may never see another suntime,&rdquo; added
  Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll never taste a crystal cube again.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach stared down at the dusty ground. &nbsp;He licked his antennae once or twice. &nbsp;Then
  he began to study his pile of crystal cubes. &nbsp;He thought and thought for a very long time. &nbsp;Finally, he looked up at
  the three bug-fellows, all waiting for an answer. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What are you staring at?&rdquo; grumbled Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go. &nbsp;All
  right?</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">... &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.1pxezwc" id="h.1pxezwc"></a>Chapter 22: Sparkle Dust</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hurry! &nbsp;Hurry now! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s nearly
  suntime,&rdquo; warned Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;In fact, this will probably be our last trip to the boat.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Our last trip?&rdquo; exclaimed Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;re going to leave
  all these other crystal cubes behind? &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve only made two trips so far.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Four, Brother Blattidae. &nbsp;This will be our fifth trip.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;All I remember is Stinkbug dumping half a load of crystal cubes into the grass on one of
  those trips.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Look how high you piled them! &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t help it if I dropped a
  few.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I covered them with my best black spit so they&rsquo;d stick to your back, and by the time
  you got to the boat, half of them were gone! &nbsp;And you take so long crawling across the lawn! &nbsp;If you weren&rsquo;t so
  slow, we could have made six trips by now.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c3">The sky was beginning to surrender its darkness to the pink glow of a new
  suntime</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;when the bugs started their last trip across the lawn. &nbsp;Book Louse lead the way again.
  &nbsp;Cockroach was right behind, clutching a crystal cube between his back legs and balancing another on his back.
  &nbsp;Stinkbug and Acorn Weevil tried to keep up, but every time Stinkbug&rsquo;s load began to slip, they had to stop and make
  adjustments and they kept falling further and further behind. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;There you go, Red-Eyes,&rdquo; Acorn Weevil said, stopping again to push a crystal
  cube to the center of Stinkbug&rsquo;s back. &nbsp;&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; &nbsp;Then looking up towards the others, far
  ahead, she said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better catch up or Not So Fancy will be treating us to another temper tantrum.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Ha, ha! &nbsp;Schnoot</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; Acorn Weevil laughed to herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You go ahead, Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not go-going on. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m... I&rsquo;m
  go-going back.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;|What? &nbsp;Going</span> <span class="c2">back</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo; exclaimed
  Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Did she say... she was going back? Maybe our little ear holes are plugged with
  humming box dust. &nbsp;We must have heard her wrong</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No, y-you heard it correctly,&rdquo; stammered Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ve decided
  to... to go... go back. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m go-going back.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s</span> <span class="c2">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in the plan!
  &nbsp;Pale Belly never mentioned this! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Not in the plan. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re right. &nbsp;Never in
  the plan</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s always been in</span> <span class="c2">my</span><span class=
  "c4">&nbsp;plan. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s why I left Meadowfield in the first place.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug took a deep sigh and then
  continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;I came across the soft cold for one reason and that was to find Silverfish. &nbsp;And now that I found
  her, I can&rsquo;t simply leave her behind. &nbsp;Even if it means,&rdquo; she gulped, &ldquo;well, even if it means I
  don&rsquo;t make it ba-back myself.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug could feel her perfumery tighten up. &nbsp;She began to feel
  faint.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s loony!&rdquo; exclaimed Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class=
  "c2">Loony as a click beetle... she is. &nbsp;Maybe even loonier than that</span><span class="c4">!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go before I change my mind. &nbsp;Tell the others... tell them not to
  worry. &nbsp;Tell Cockroach to enjoy his cubes. &nbsp;May-maybe I&rsquo;ll be back with another load. &nbsp;Keep listening to
  Book Louse. &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll get you back home. &nbsp;You... you&rsquo;ll be back in your acorn tree in no time at all. &nbsp;Go
  on now, my dear Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;Go on, and don&rsquo;t look back.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stinkbug gave Acorn Weevil a long hug.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Good-bye, my friend.&rdquo; &nbsp;She turned and hurried off through the grasses and into the shadows.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Acorn Weevil watched her until she disappeared. &nbsp;Just like that, she was gone. &nbsp;Acorn
  Weevil was stunned. &nbsp;It was some time before she realized that Stinkbug was not coming back. &nbsp;With little else to do,
  she headed toward the boat, feeling sad and empty.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Still in a daze, Acorn Weevil arrived at the boat. &nbsp;Cockroach and Book Louse were standing on
  the deck, looking over the side. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time!&rdquo; growled Cockroach pacing back and forth along the
  deck. &nbsp;&ldquo;Stinkbug seems to be taking her sweet time getting here! &nbsp;How many crystal cubes did she leave behind
  this time?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;She went back,&rdquo; Acorn Weevil cried. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wide Red-Eyes went
  back!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do you mean she went back!&rdquo; shouted Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;What about all those
  crystal cubes I loaded on her shell!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;She took them with her, Not So Fancy.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The thief! &nbsp;The rotten-bottomed thief! &nbsp;She took off with the crystal cubes.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">My</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;crystal cubes! &nbsp;Why didn&rsquo;t you stop
  her?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cousin Curculio,&rdquo; Book Louse interrupted. &nbsp;&ldquo;What is she thinking?
  &nbsp;Why would she go back?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The bristle-tail... &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Schnort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;It
  was because of the bristle-tail, Pale Belly.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Sister Saccharina, the silverfish! &nbsp;I was afraid of this,&rdquo; said Book Louse.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I was afraid this might happen.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you stop her before she ran off with all of my
  cubes!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Brother Blattidae! &nbsp;You have more than enough crystal cubes on
  board.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have</span> <span class="c2">more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;if Stinkbug
  wasn&rsquo;t so dumb!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Oh</span><span class="c4">, Pale Belly! &nbsp;Do you think she will
  be all right? &nbsp;Will she make it back? &nbsp;Will we ever see her again? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes! &nbsp;Yes!
  &nbsp;What do you think</span><span class="c4">? &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">We are so worried!</span><span class=
  "c4">&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;It depends. &nbsp;It depends on when the Loomers wake up, for one
  thing. &nbsp;And of course, it depends on how stubborn Sister Saccharina is about leaving. &nbsp;Her mind is nearly rotted out
  with glue. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d calculate the odds of Ms Pentatomidae&rsquo;s survival are approximately, oh say, 1 out of
  555.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Schnort! &nbsp;Is that bad?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not bad. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s</span> <span class=
  "c2">awful</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; exclaimed Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was a foolish thing to do! &nbsp;And look at the
  skies. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re just moments away from suntime!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Should we go back too? &nbsp;Find her and bring her back? &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Schnort! &nbsp;Go back and save her! &nbsp;You must be crazy!</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; Acorn Weevil argued to
  herself.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;Going back won&rsquo;t help,&rdquo; answered Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s
  made up her mind to save Sister Saccharina and we can&rsquo;t stop her. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re safe now. &nbsp;If we go back
  we&rsquo;ll all be dusted. &nbsp;We just need to wait and hope.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c3">When suntime arrived, the bug-fellows found themselves in a deep fog that had settled in along the
  warm shoreline of The Waters.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; The fog was so thick, they could barely see their own antennae.
  &nbsp;They tried to look across the lawn to the Loomer home, but they couldn&rsquo;t even see the lawn. &nbsp;Every sound from
  the shore lifted their hopes of seeing Stinkbug emerge from the fog, but each time they were met with disappointment. &nbsp;There
  was no sign of poor Stinkbug. &nbsp;No sign at all.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Acorn Weevil decided to seek a better view above the fog. &nbsp;She flew to an overhanging branch
  and positioned herself high above the boat.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do you see from up there, Cousin Curculio?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Not too much, I&rsquo;m sad to say...</span> <span class="c2">schnort</span><span class=
  "c4">! &nbsp;Lawn and leaves and trees, I can tell you.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No sign of Ms. Pentatomidae?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;Nothing.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What about my crystal cubes?&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach growled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Did Stinkbug even
  bother to leave them behind?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Can you see the Loomer home yet?&rdquo; asked Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Yes, we do. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">See it real good too.
  &nbsp;Schnort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;You can see it too... when the damp-air burns off.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Nothing. &nbsp;We think everything looks perfectly quiet.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It didn&rsquo;t stay quiet for long. &nbsp;The fog finally disappeared and the Loomer home was now
  visible from the boat. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s when Acorn Weevil spotted something coming out of the storeroom. &nbsp;It was a Loomer,
  and it was carrying something with it. &nbsp;A big yellow something-or-other. &nbsp;&ldquo;Loomer alert! &nbsp;Loomer
  alert!&rdquo; she shouted. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">We see that nasty old Loomer! &nbsp;Yes we do! &nbsp;We see that
  ugly two-legged bug-beater</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We see it too!&rdquo; said Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s carrying?&rdquo; asked Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That, Brother Blattidae, is a big vat of sparkle dust. &nbsp;An</span> <span class=
  "c2">enormous</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;vat of sparkle dust!&rdquo; &nbsp;And looking up to Acorn Weevil, &ldquo;No signs of
  Ms. Pentatomidae?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t see a sign.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, Ms. Pentatomidae, if you aren&rsquo;t out of there soon...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sparkle dust?&rdquo; said Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it going to
  do with it?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to use it! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s going to fill the Loomer home with sparkle
  dust even thicker than the fog that just lifted!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s doing something with that big yellow thing. &nbsp;Pouring something into
  it,&rdquo; reported Acorn Weevil.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sparkle dust!&rdquo; Book Louse shouted up to Acorn Weevil.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about to dust everything!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Schnort! &nbsp;Sparkle dust! &nbsp;Oh no. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the sparkle dust. &nbsp;You
  mean... Schnort!... it&rsquo;s really going to use it! &nbsp;Wide Red-Eyes! &nbsp;Where are you? &nbsp;Get out. &nbsp;Get out of
  there quick!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Loomer covered its face with something and began to push up and down on the yellow vat.
  &nbsp;Up and down. &nbsp;Harder and harder it pushed. &nbsp;Up and down. &nbsp;Up and down.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Come on Ms. Pentatomidae! &nbsp;Now! &nbsp;You must leave now!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Loomer stopped pushing on the yellow vat. &nbsp;It held up a line or tube of some kind with a
  silver tip at the end.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Come on Stinkbug,&rdquo; whispered Cockroach under his breath. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on you big
  bottomed pest.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Loomer crouched over the yellow vat and lifted it up. &nbsp;It raised the silver-tipped tube.
  &nbsp;It turned slowly toward the Loomer home.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Curculio! &nbsp;Anything! &nbsp;Do you see her anywhere?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">WHOOOOOOSHHHHHHH!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; It was a sickening, unnatural sound, more hideous
  than the grinding sound of a hundred bully wasp jaws, more disgusting than the sounds of the robber fly, swooping and sucking out
  the souls of its prey. &nbsp;It was so repulsive, even Cockroach ran to the side of the boat and threw up.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">WOOOOOO... WOO... WOO... WOO... WOOOOOSHHHHHHHHH</span><span class="c4">!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Hugh billowing clouds of yellow dust poured from the silver-tipped tube. &nbsp;The Loomer stopped
  for a moment to adjust the cover over its face and then it stepped into the Loomer home, silver-tipped tube in hand. &nbsp;With
  the yellow vat strapped tightly to its back, it disappeared into the cloud of sparkle dust filling the Loomer home, pouring into
  every crack and crevice, seeping into every nook and cranny.</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.49x2ik5" id="h.49x2ik5"></a>Chapter 23: Waking Up</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">A piece of ice slipped from the frozen reeds at the edge of
  Meadow Pond. &nbsp;It drifted from the shore and quietly melted away. &nbsp;Warm breezes carrying the scent of wildflowers and
  the odor of skunk cabbage rippled across the water. &nbsp;The sky was high and crystal blue. &nbsp;Soon it would be teeming with
  bug-fellows eager to try new wings and explore new foraging grounds. &nbsp;These were the Warming Times, and Meadowfield was
  coming to life.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Bluebottle Flies were among the first bug-fellows to appear. &nbsp;Darting about in the marsh
  grasses, they searched for frozen carcasses of Long-Horns, Fur-Fangs or Mud-Whats; victims of the Great Cold; bodies laid bare by
  the melting soft cold and rotting in the suntime heat. &nbsp;Mosquitoes and gnats and a few drowsy butterflies followed.
  &nbsp;Soon the bees would arrive, hundreds of them swarming down from their hives to work the flowering fields.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">One such hive was already beginning to bustle about in the hollow of their old oak tree. &nbsp;It
  was the hive of Worker 1200. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I think I could have slept forever,&rdquo; said Worker 1200, stretching out her
  stiff legs. &nbsp;It had been a long sleep and her wings hung like a pair of wilted leaves. &nbsp;She started pumping them up
  with blood. &nbsp;&ldquo;Getting feeling back in these old wings now!&rdquo; &nbsp;Worker 1200 wobbled to her legs. &nbsp;She
  stumbled across the honeycombed nursery cells where broods of bee grubs squirmed about, preparing for the suntime when they would
  replace her and all the other old worker bees.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">But Worker 1200 had much to do before the young upstarts emerged from their cells. &nbsp;There
  would be nectar collections, hive repair, and most importantly, preparation for the Queen&rsquo;s Great Cicada Emergence
  Bug-Fellow Ball. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh! &nbsp;This Ball&rsquo;s going to be so much work!&rdquo; she thought. &nbsp;It made her want to
  go back to sleep and forget the whole thing. &nbsp;She knew that was out of the question. &nbsp;Her Queen would never tolerate
  such insubordination.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">She finished pumping up her wings just as a messenger of the Queen approached. &nbsp;The messenger
  was wiggling and waggling all over the hive, causing quite a commotion. &nbsp;The waggle dance could mean only one thing.
  &nbsp;Nectar had been located. &nbsp;&ldquo;How</span> <span class="c2">far</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is this nectar?&rdquo;
  said Worker 1200 studying the messenger&rsquo;s dance. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be serious! All the way across the pasture!
  &nbsp;The Queen expects me to fly all the way to the other side of Meadow Pond? &nbsp;Just what does she think I am?
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;never</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;flown that far in my life, not even on my first
  meadow flowering when I was young, full of energy, barely more than a grub!&rdquo; &nbsp;Worker 1200 sighed heavily. &nbsp;She
  started to pump extra blood into her wings. &nbsp;It was going to be a long suntime.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c38">Far across the meadow, where the pasture overlooks Meadow Pond, another resident of
  Meadowfield was waking up.&nbsp; It was Praying Mantis.&nbsp; He had spent the entire Great Cold trying to stay warm under an old
  log, praying he would live to see one more blade of grass, feel the warmth of one more suntime and enjoy the taste of honey on
  his tongue once again. He prayed long and hard for all these things, but there was one thing he prayed for most of all. &nbsp;The
  event of a lifetime, he called it. &nbsp;An event every bug-fellow, waking up on this beautiful suntime, was probably buzzing
  about right now. &nbsp;It was the event that would make this the best Warming Times ever.&nbsp; It was the Emergence of the Great
  Cicada.&nbsp; Countless activities were planned, with feasts and celebrations to attend, and a Grand Ball when the Great Cicada
  himself would make his long awaited appearance after seventeen Great Colds.&nbsp; The honey would run sweeter, the trees stretch
  taller, and the grass grow deeper than ever before.&nbsp; The thought of it all made Mantis giddy with delight. His prayers were
  going to be answered.&nbsp; It was good to be alive!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c38">To calm his delirious excitement, Mantis flew to the top of a twisted branch, stretched out
  his body once more, relaxed, and began to meditate.&nbsp; His body swayed from side to side as he hummed a single note.&nbsp;
  &ldquo;Ooommmm&hellip; Ooommmm,&rdquo; he crooned.&nbsp; Then he flew into the bright, blue sky.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He circled above Meadow Pond. &nbsp;He watched the Blue Bottle Flies scouring the banks below him.
  &nbsp;Old Yellow Fat was up and about, poking around in the reeds, probably making plans for another season of Waterboatmen
  races. &nbsp;Mantis flew across the pond to where The Waters flowed down from the hills. &nbsp;He swooped just low enough to feel
  the icy spray of the stream in his face. &nbsp;He dipped and rolled and soared, his body bursting with energy.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">As he flew farther up The Waters and toward the hills, he noticed an odd tingling on his antennae.
  &nbsp;At first, Mantis ignored the sensation. &nbsp;&ldquo;Probably just some irritating pollen I have run into,&rdquo; he
  thought. &nbsp;But the tingling continued. &nbsp;Before long, Mantis was beginning to feel sick to his stomach and he circled
  back toward the pond. &nbsp;He landed in the marsh reeds and began licking his antennae clean. &nbsp;They tasted bad. &nbsp;It
  was like nothing he had tasted before. &nbsp;It stung his tongue and made him feel even sicker. &nbsp;&ldquo;There is something
  bad up there, over The Waters,&rdquo; Mantis thought. &nbsp;&ldquo;Something very bad in the air.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">He sprawled out on the ground to rest when a voice rang out. &nbsp;&ldquo;Mantis!
  &nbsp;Mantis!&rdquo; the voice called from the sky. &nbsp;&ldquo;Mantis, is that you?&rdquo; &nbsp;Praying Mantis slowly turned
  his head toward the bright sky. &nbsp;A great swarm of bees was passing overhead. &nbsp;One bee was flying down toward him.
  &nbsp;It was Worker 1200.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 landed gently beside her old friend. &nbsp;&ldquo;Top of the suntime to you, Mantis!
  &nbsp;You</span> <span class="c2">are</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a sight for these tired old eyes of mine. &nbsp;Can you
  believe it? &nbsp;Who would&rsquo;ve thought we&rsquo;d still be around after The Great Cold? &nbsp;Glad to see you made it
  through.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And thou as well, little bee. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s good to see</span> <span class=
  "c3">thee</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;I seeth thy swarm is very busy.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh yes. &nbsp;Back to work.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then coming up close to Mantis she whispered,
  &ldquo;Just between you and me, our Queen is a real slave-driver! &nbsp;But you didn&rsquo;t hear that from me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Mantis chuckled. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">So where is thy swarm
  heading?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Beyond the far side of Meadow Pond, some distance up The Waters. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a
  group of marsh flowers just dripping with nectar.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, be careful. &nbsp;I was just in that area and I picked up something most unpleasant
  on my antennae.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;There is always some danger,&rdquo; remarked Worker 1200. &nbsp;&ldquo;Robber flies,
  Waspers, Mud-Whats, any one of them could...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;I do not mean that. &nbsp;Not anything like that,&rdquo; Mantis interrupted.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;It is in the air. &nbsp;A strange odor seems to be blowing down from the Smoking Hills. &nbsp;I have no idea what it
  could</span> <span class="c3">be. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t like the smell</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;It made my stomach
  hurt.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it in mind, Mantis. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be sure to...&rdquo; Worker 1200
  paused as if puzzling over something. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wait. &nbsp;Now that you mention this, the Queen&rsquo;s scout did say
  something. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time. &nbsp;But now that you bring this up.
  &nbsp;Hummm.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Humm? &nbsp;What is hummm?&rdquo; said Mantis impatiently. &nbsp;&ldquo;What did</span>
  <span class="c3">thy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;scout say?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The scout said he saw something in the sky over The Waters, just beyond the marsh flowers.
  &nbsp;It made him turn back. &nbsp;A &lsquo;sparkling&rsquo; he called it. &nbsp;A strange sparkling in the sky, like a mist.
  &nbsp;With a</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;bad</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;taste. &nbsp;A strange sparkling in the sky over The
  Waters.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Schnort</span><span class="c4">!
  &nbsp;How much longer should we wait?&rdquo; &nbsp;Acorn Weevil asked.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; &ldquo;How could we ask such
  a question</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo; she scolded herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please excuse me,&rdquo; she answered back.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;We meant no disrespect. &nbsp;We were only curious. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;ve given up on Wide Red-Eyes.
  &nbsp;We certainly didn&rsquo;t want to just</span> <span class="c2">leave</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Oh sure! &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t want to leave. &nbsp;Indeed! &nbsp;Just what do you take us for</span><span class=
  "c4">?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cousin Curculio. &nbsp;Please! &nbsp;Get a hold of yourself! &nbsp;This is not the time
  to...&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes... Snorttle-snorf. &nbsp;Not the time for our nerves to spin out of control.
  &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what Pale Belly was about to say.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Schnort! &nbsp;Yes, he was. &nbsp;He certainly
  was. &nbsp;That Pale Belly bug thinks we&rsquo;re cracking up</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cousin Curculio, why don&rsquo;t you come down from those branches? &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t
  need to see anything else. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve probably seen too much already. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m afraid the shock of it all could
  cause you to fall and hurt yourself.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Like that tree-tumbling aunt with the snout stuck in her head,&rdquo; added
  Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;You</span> <span class="c2">do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;remember that ridiculous story you told us,
  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Of course we do.&rdquo; replied Acorn Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;But, we still think it may have
  been our sister.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Whatever. &nbsp;Come down and rest. &nbsp;Brother Blattidae will take your watch.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Won&rsquo;t</span> <span class="c4">you?&rdquo; Book Louse said to Cockroach with a nod of his
  head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now come down. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing more you can do for Ms. Pentatomidae.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Schnort! &nbsp;Very well... &nbsp;But if Not So Fancy is coming up here, he&rsquo;d better
  keep a sharp eye open. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes, he should. &nbsp;He certainly should. &nbsp;Can&rsquo;t come up here if
  he doesn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he will do just fine.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach headed up the branches. &nbsp;Acorn Weevil made it down in one piece, but she
  couldn&rsquo;t rest, even for a moment. &nbsp;She paced up and down the boat, back and forth, sputtering and muttering to
  herself. &nbsp;Book Louse tried to calm her by reciting several soothing lines of poetry. &nbsp;But that didn&rsquo;t work.
  &nbsp;He tried some Sigmund Freud from the pages of a tasty psychology book he once nibbled on. &nbsp;That didn&rsquo;t work
  either. &nbsp;He even tried to cheer her up with some old pest jokes. &nbsp;But Acorn Weevil didn&rsquo;t get any of them.
  &nbsp;Then, suddenly, Acorn Weevil&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in her head. &nbsp;She took a deep breath, and passed out on the</span>
  <span class="c3">deck, totally exhausted.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; sighed Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. &nbsp;You rest. &nbsp;You
  rest there, Cousin Curculio. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll keep watch for Ms. Pentatomidae.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse crawled along the rail of the boat and waited. &nbsp;There was still no movement on the
  lawn. &nbsp;The cloud of sparkle dust still covered the Loomer home like a great yellow cocoon. &nbsp;Cockroach and Book Louse
  didn&rsquo;t exchange a single word. &nbsp;They just waited and worried. &nbsp;They knew the chances of Stinkbug&rsquo;s survival
  grew dimmer and dimmer with each passing moment.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">From his lookout spot in the branches, a wet-drop fell from Cockroach&rsquo;s eye and splattered
  on the rail beside Book Louse. &nbsp;Book Louse never noticed it, much to Cockroach&rsquo;s relief. &nbsp;Cockroach quickly wiped
  the other wet-drops from his eye</span><span class="c3">s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;before Book Louse could see them. &nbsp;He
  had never, in his whole life, made a wet-drop! &nbsp;Now he couldn&rsquo;t stop making them. &nbsp;He forced down a hard swallow,
  took a deep breath and tried to put on his best Cockroach scowl.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The wind is shifting,&rdquo; said Book Louse, finally breaking the silence. &nbsp;Cockroach
  didn&rsquo;t answer. &nbsp;He still had a lump in his throat and was afraid he might choke over his words. &nbsp;&ldquo;Brother
  Blattidae. &nbsp;Are you still up there?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ahhhh...</span> <span class="c2">gulp</span><span class="c4">... ahhh... y-yes,&rdquo;
  Cockroach finally answered.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I said, the wind is shifting,&rdquo; Book Louse repeated. &nbsp;&ldquo;Toward us. &nbsp;See
  the leaves rustling in our direction?&rdquo; &nbsp;Cockroach didn&rsquo;t answer. &nbsp;There was a long silence. &nbsp;&ldquo;It
  is time.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Time. &nbsp;What do you mean, time?&rdquo; asked Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It is time we go. &nbsp;My antennae are beginning to tingle. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re picking up
  the scent of sparkle dust. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s blowing in this direction. &nbsp;We can&rsquo;t wait any longer. &nbsp;We must leave,
  right away.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But what about Stinkbug?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there is nothing more we can do, Brother Blattidae.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But, surely we can stay just a little longer? &nbsp;I don&#39;t taste that dust yet.
  &nbsp;The winds could shift away.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse was surprised by Cockroach&rsquo;s concern, but he felt he should not mention it.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Come down to the deck now, Brother Blattidae. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll wake our captain and inform him of our immediate
  departure.&rdquo; &nbsp;Book Louse slipped away and disappeared through a large opening in the red, block-shaped structure at the
  front of the boat.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cockroach sighed heavily. &nbsp;Now his antennae began to tingle too. &nbsp;He took a long, last
  look across the empty lawn. &nbsp;A horrible vision of Stinkbug came to his mind. &nbsp;She was covered in a cloud of sparkle
  dust, body spinning, antennae twitching, her red eyes popping out of her head. &nbsp;It scared him so much that he let out a
  terrible scream. &nbsp;He stumbled off the branch and fell, head over abdomen, out of the tree.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Whaa... what was that!&rdquo; shouted Acorn Weevil suddenly coming awake. &nbsp;She cleared
  her eyes just in time to see Cockroach dropping out of the sky. &nbsp;His legs were thrashing about in every direction. &nbsp;He
  hit the water with a smacking belly flop. &nbsp;It was a most ungraceful entry.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I suppose you think that was real funny, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; sputtered Cockroach as he
  came to the surface. &nbsp;&ldquo;I slipped, that&rsquo;s all. &nbsp;I just slipped. &nbsp;Fell asleep or something!&rdquo;
  &nbsp;Acorn Weevil was staring over the side of the rail in disbelief. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&#39;t just stand there gawking, you
  long-nosed Nit! &nbsp;Get me out of here!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It took some struggling, and a little help from Acorn Weevil, before Cockroach was able to get
  himself over the rail and into the boat. &nbsp;He propped himself up against the rail and sat there, dripping and puffing and
  panting. &nbsp;Suddenly the boat began to shudder below them. &nbsp;They were heading away from the shore.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re</span> <span class="c2">leaving</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo; exclaimed Acorn
  Weevil. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why are we...</span> <span class="c2">schnort</span><span class="c4">... leaving?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The sparkle dust is blowing toward us,&rdquo; answered Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;We have to
  go.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Acorn Weevil hung her head and began to cry. &nbsp;It was a pitiful sound filled with blubbering
  and snorting. &nbsp;Wet-drops poured from her bulbous eyes and dripped off her snout in a steady stream. &nbsp;&ldquo;Poor Red
  Eyes!&rdquo; she moaned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Poor poor poor...</span> <span class="c2">schnort</span><span class="c4">...</span>
  <span class="c2">schnock</span><span class="c4">... poor Red Eyes!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">With all of Acorn Weevil&rsquo;s moanings and groanings, Cockroach almost didn&rsquo;t hear the
  voices. &nbsp;The sounds were far away. &nbsp;But they</span> <span class="c2">did</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;sound like
  voices. &nbsp;&ldquo;Quiet! &nbsp;You sniveling sap-sucker!&rdquo; demanded Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;I hear something!
  &nbsp;Where&rsquo;s Book Louse! &nbsp;Get him over here!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Schhhhhh-nock</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; &nbsp;Acorn Weevil
  sucked a wad of wet-drops up her snout. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not So Fancy says he hears something?&rdquo; she sputtered.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yes! &nbsp;Yes! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what he said. &nbsp;Said he heard
  something</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Voices could be heard again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Do you hear it?&rdquo; said Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you hear it? &nbsp;On the shore...
  voices coming from the shore over there. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure of it. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got to stop the boat! &nbsp;Tell that
  little gnat to stop the boat! &nbsp;Tell him to stop the boat right</span> <span class="c2">now</span><span class=
  "c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.147n2zr" id="h.147n2zr"></a>Chapter 25: Out of the Hills</h2>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Apparently the message reached Book Louse because the boat
  suddenly came to a stop. &nbsp;Everything was very quiet. &nbsp;All that could be heard was the gentle lapping of water against
  the sides of the boat. &nbsp;There was no sound or movement along the shore.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; called Book Louse, rushing up beside the others.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Voices,&rdquo; replied Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shhhhhh. &nbsp;Listen. &nbsp;I heard
  voices.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What kind of voices?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! &nbsp;Voices. &nbsp;Just voices, somewhere along the
  shore.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse squinted her tiny pink eyes and looked up and down the shore. &nbsp;Acorn Weevil curled
  up in a tight ball and listened for the slightest sound. &nbsp;The reeds along the shore bent and swayed in the gentle breeze.
  &nbsp;A black, red-shouldered Beak Beast landed on a stout reed. &nbsp;It screamed several times and flew off. &nbsp;Everything
  became still and quiet again.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Brother Blattidae, we&rsquo;ve been listening for a long time and we haven&rsquo;t heard a
  thing,&rdquo; Book Louse finally said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure you heard voices? &nbsp;You know, your mind can play tricks on
  you when you&rsquo;re out to sea.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m</span> <span class="c2">sure</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I heard
  something,&rdquo; Cockroach sighed. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse nodded his head and turned to go back to the front of the boat. &nbsp;Acorn Weevil
  sighed. &nbsp;All hung their heads in disappointment.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Suddenly there was a great rush of wind from overhead. &nbsp;At first, all three bug-fellows
  thought it was a Beak Beast attacking from the sky. &nbsp;They ducked down along the deck as quickly as they could. &nbsp;It
  swooped over them again. &nbsp;Cockroach thought it sounded too small for a Beak Beast, but like the others, he was afraid to
  look up. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a robber fly,&rdquo; he thought. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, great! &nbsp;Just what we need
  now!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Schnort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;What</span> <span class=
  "c2">is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;this thing flying above us?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Then, with a jarring thud, something landed in the front of the boat. &nbsp;It fell somewhere
  behind the red block-like structure and so was hidden from view. &nbsp;The bug-fellows picked themselves from the deck and looked
  at each other with a stunned silence.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">At that moment, striding toward them from the front of the boat in Loomer-long leaps, was none
  other than Grand Daddy Long-Legs, puffing and panting and calling out commands. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">To arms!
  &nbsp;To arms</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">he
  shouted</span><span class="c2 c6">.</span> <span class="c2">&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been invaded! &nbsp;They&rsquo;ve struck
  from the skies! &nbsp;Bombed from above! &nbsp;Kamikazed us like sitting ducks!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What is</span> <span class="c2">he</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;doing here?&rdquo;
  exclaimed the confused Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Schnort</span><span class="c4">! &nbsp;We never knew he could fly.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yes. &nbsp;Yes</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; Acorn Weevil said to herself.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">We&rsquo;ve made a very good point. &nbsp;We certainly have. &nbsp;A pest that flies without
  wings is an odd one indeed</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;No, he&rsquo;s been here all along,&rdquo; said Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;In all
  the worry and confusion, I never introduced our captain. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; he pointed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Grand Daddy-Long
  Legs is our captain!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh great!&rdquo; groaned Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;It just keeps getting
  better.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Circle the wagons! &nbsp;Man the lifeboats! &nbsp;Woman and
  children first!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he blabbering about?&rdquo; shouted Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;And what in the
  name of spittle bug spit landed in the front of the boat?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh my goodness,&rdquo; gasped Book Louse pointing to the front of the boat.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">A thick cloud of purple vapor was billowing up from behind the red block-like structure at the
  front of the boat. &nbsp;It poured over the sides of the boat and drifted down the deck. &nbsp;The vapor carried that old
  familiar smell.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think?&rdquo; exclaimed Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine!&rdquo; remarked Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe!&rdquo; choked Acorn Weevil.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Stinkbug? &nbsp;Is that you?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The three bug-fellows practically ran each other over to get to the front of the boat. &nbsp;Grand
  Daddy Long-Legs started bouncing back and forth, hopping from rail to rail like a Green-Skinned Sticky Tongue that had just
  swallowed a hornet. &nbsp;He was still convinced the boat was under attack. &nbsp;It was a wild sight indeed. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">When the bug-fellows reached the front of the boat, there she was; her head bent up underneath her
  body, her back up against the rail and her legs wiggling away above her. &nbsp;The air was filled with purple vapor, pouring from
  her bottom. &nbsp;The vapor never smelled so good.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Red Eyes! &nbsp;Red Eyes! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Schnort</span><span class="c4">!
  &nbsp;It&rsquo;s you! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s really you! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re alive! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re alive! &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c2">Well... at least we think you are</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alive,&rdquo; Stinkbug groaned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe a little sore, but I can
  assure you, I am very much alive indeed.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Help her up, Brother Blattidae,&rdquo; laughed Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
  some celebrating to do!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Be careful how you move me, Cockroach,&rdquo; warned Stinkbug. &nbsp;&ldquo;I brought
  something with me. &nbsp;I think my passenger might be underneath me.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You mean you brought some more crystal cubes with you?&rdquo; Cockroach exclaimed with
  excitement.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ah, no Cockroach, you old stink-piler,&rdquo; said a voice coming out from under
  Stinkbug&rsquo;s twisted body. &nbsp;&ldquo;She brought me.&rdquo; &nbsp;And out from under Stinkbug&rsquo;s shell came yet
  another surprise&mdash;a battered bug-fellow with scaly skin and a slippery shell, with a pair of beady, black eyes below what
  was once a fine pair of silver antennae, now bent and twisted into knots. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t look quite the same as Cockroach
  had remembered her. &nbsp;Still, there was no mistaking her. &nbsp;It was Silverfish.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Sister Saccharina!&rdquo; exclaimed Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made it!
  &nbsp;This</span> <span class="c2">is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a surprise! &nbsp;In fact, it&rsquo;s a statistical
  impossibility! &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t begin to calculate the odds. &nbsp;Yet here you are, both of you! &nbsp;Ms. Pentatomidae,
  you</span> <span class="c2">do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;amaze me! &nbsp;How did you do it?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Just followed the Termites through the roof. &nbsp;They had their own escape route from the
  attic. &nbsp;Had it all planned and prepared for just such an emergency. &nbsp;Silverfish was the hard part. &nbsp;She had to eat
  three crystal cubes before I could get her away from the glue.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hummmmph! &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">One</span> <span class="c4">crystal cube should
  have been enough!&rdquo; grunted Cockroach giving Silverfish a hard stare.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re here and you&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo; declared Book Louse. &nbsp;&ldquo;And
  that&rsquo;s what matters!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what matters,&rdquo; agreed Acorn Weevil.
  &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Schnort! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re right about that! &nbsp;When you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re
  right! &nbsp;We still think that Pale Belly is one smart fellow</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Turning to Grand Daddy Long-Legs, Book Louse said cheerfully, &ldquo;Captain. &nbsp;Full steam
  ahead. &nbsp;Everything here looks shipshape from stem to stern. &nbsp;Pipe up the bosun&rsquo;s whistle. &nbsp;Give us a rousing
  round of your best sea chantey, and let&rsquo;s blow the man down!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Grand Daddy Long-Legs stood as high as his eight legs could lift him. &nbsp;He puffed up, his tiny
  abdomen proud and full, and presented everyone with a crisp salute. &nbsp;Then he turned sharply on his skinny legs and strutted
  to the opening in the red-block structure and slipped inside it. &nbsp;The boat suddenly lurched ahead and the vessel of merry
  bug-fellows headed down The Waters with the singing of Grand Daddy Long-Legs echoing from shore to shore.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">His song went like this:</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When I was just a spindly nymph</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">My dear old mother told me.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">Hey, haul away! &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll haul away-o!</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">That if I did not use my head</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">My brain would all grow moldy!</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">Hey, haul away! &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll haul away-o!</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">I thought about my mother&rsquo;s words</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">But never could I tell her.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">Hey haul away! &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll haul away-o!</span></p>

  <p class="c26"><span class="c2">Too late to try, my brain was fried,</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">But that&rsquo;s another story!</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c31"><span class="c2">Hey haul away! &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll haul away-o! &nbsp;Ho!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c10"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">None of the bug-fellows understood any of the song, except maybe Book Louse. &nbsp;But soon they
  were all singing it together, over and over and over again; singing and laughing together, until the boat was far away from the
  Loomer home. &nbsp;Singing and laughing still, while the Smoking Hills disappeared behind them in a veil of darkness.
  &nbsp;Singing and laughing together as the long suntime drew to a close.</span></p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title"><a name="h.gn48nye82kd5" id="h.gn48nye82kd5"></a>Chapter 26: Home</h2>

  <p class="c18"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The bug-fellows&rsquo; celebration continued throughout the
  suntime&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Ample amounts of crystal cubes were consumed by all, much to the displeasure of Cockroach.&nbsp; He
  gnashed his mandibles in anger every time Silverfish took a taste of the precious cubes.&nbsp; Book Louse explained it was all
  part of the rehabilitation program he had developed to wean Silverfish from the book-binding glue. &nbsp;Book Louse laughed and
  assured him there would be plenty of crystal cubes for everyone and Cockroach too.&nbsp; Acorn Weevil wasn&rsquo;t impressed with
  the taste anyway and went back to her lumps of white flour powder.&nbsp; For Grand Daddy Long-Legs, the crystal cubes had a
  unique effect.&nbsp; The more he tasted, the more hyperactive he became.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t long before he was bouncing from
  rail to rail, singing, spinning, and twisting about like a loony click beetle.&nbsp; Sitting off in the shadows, Stinkbug calmly
  sucked down marsh reed juice while she listened to Silverfish&rsquo;s rambling tales of her adventures through Meadowfield.&nbsp;
  Tales of how she escaped from bands of robber flies.&nbsp;</span> <span class="c3">Her meeting with Scarab the Dung and all the
  magical potions and magical spells the Dung Beetle shared with her.&nbsp; Her</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;trip to the Smoking
  Hills.&nbsp; Beak Beasts, Long Horns, Loomers and so on... and so on... and on.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">By the next suntime, the bug-fellows found themselves pleasantly exhausted.&nbsp; Grand Daddy
  Long-Legs had regained his composure and was navigating the boat with surprising precision.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t long before
  they arrived at Acorn Weevil&rsquo;s nut tree, where they would all bid Acorn Weevil a fond farewell.&nbsp; She was happy to see
  the familiar boughs and branches of her home and wasted no time scrambling up.&nbsp; Although she was happy to be back, she knew
  a part of her would always remain back in the lands she had discovered so far from her nut tree home.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Good-bye... Snort... snort!&nbsp; Good-bye bug-nappers!&rdquo; she waved down to the
  boat.&nbsp; Everyone waved back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye!&nbsp; And listen, please.&nbsp; Snort!&nbsp; If you pass this way
  again... come with a plan!&nbsp;</span> <span class="c2">Snort!&nbsp; Yes, a plan indeed</span><span class="c4">!&nbsp; What can
  be so foolish as a group of bug-nappers without a plan!&nbsp;</span> <span class="c2">Yes!&nbsp; Yes</span><span class=
  "c4">!&rdquo; she said to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Bug-nappers without a plan... how
  foolish</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">that is</span><span class="c4">!&nbsp; Snort!&nbsp; But then
  again... what a time we had!&nbsp; What an incredible time indeed!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The bug-fellows waved and waved from the back of the boat until the nut tree home disappeared
  behind a bend.&nbsp; Stinkbug was the last to stop waving.&nbsp; Standing alone on the deck, she felt a sudden emptiness, now
  that Acorn Weevil was no longer snorting and sneezing beside her.&nbsp; She wiped a wet-drop from her wide, red eye.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Meadow Pond was the next destination.&nbsp; It was still a long way off.&nbsp; Calculating boat
  speed, water current and distance, Book Louse estimated the approximate time of arrival to be somewhere near the middle of the
  next suntime.&nbsp; His calculations proved to be correct.&nbsp; Before the end of the next suntime, the bug-fellows reached the
  heavy marshes that marked the end of The Waters and the spillway leading into Meadow Pond.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;Look Cockroach!&rdquo; shouted Stinkbug pointing to the shore.&nbsp;
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we fell into the water, wrestling over that frozen red berry.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hummph.&nbsp; How can you know that?&rdquo; replied Cockroach.&nbsp; &ldquo;It all looks
  the same to me.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">But Stinkbug was correct.&nbsp; As the boat turned into the next bend, the glistening surface of
  Meadow Pond appeared.&nbsp; It was a welcome sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;We made it!&rdquo; exclaimed Stinkbug.&nbsp; &ldquo;Meadow Pond,
  dead ahead!&nbsp; We really made it back home!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Who would have thought,&rdquo; replied Silverfish to herself as the boat slid down the
  bubbling spillway.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d see this place again.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Look over there!&nbsp; Across the pond,&rdquo; shouted Stinkbug.&nbsp; &ldquo;Waterboatman
  races!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re having Waterboatman races!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Crowding the far side of the pond, scrambling to catch a glimpse of the race, was every make and
  manner of bug-fellow.&nbsp; Old Yellow Fat was spinning on his gnarled branch. His voice carried all the way across the
  pond.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Annnnnnd coming into the first turn... taking the lead...
  it&rsquo;s... Whir-r-r-r-r-rligig!&nbsp; Then it&rsquo;s Waterboatman 3... Diving Beetle...Back Swimmer... annnnnnd closing in
  fast... coming up along the shore... it&rsquo;s Wa-a-a-a-a-ater Scorpion</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Races</span><span class="c4">?&rdquo;&nbsp; Daddy Long Legs
  suddenly exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did I hear somebody say...</span> <span class="c2">races</span><span class="c4">?&nbsp; I</span>
  <span class="c2">love</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">races!&rdquo;&nbsp; Before any of the bug-fellows
  had a chance to brace themselves, Grand Daddy Long-Legs put Ashley&rsquo;s Tony Toy Company boat into full throttle and wound up
  the pair of nine volt batteries for all they were worth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what
  this baby can really do!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The boat exploded across the surface of the pond in a streak of foam.&nbsp; Stinkbug, Book Louse,
  Silverfish, and Cockroach held on to the rails for dear life as the boat sped toward the other side of Meadow Pond.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Yeeeeeeeee... Hiiiiiiiii</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; shouted
  Grand Daddy Long-Legs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take &lsquo;em on the flank.&nbsp; Head &lsquo;em off at the pass!&nbsp; This old tug is
  ready to roll!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was an amazing sight.&nbsp; No bug in the crowd ever saw anything like the speeding boat
  heading toward them. The waterbug racers scattered in every direction as the boat came flying by.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">EEEEEE... Yeah</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo;&nbsp; Grand Daddy
  Long-Legs shouted as he drove the boat past the racing waterbugs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look out, landlubbers!&nbsp; Coming
  through!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yeah!&nbsp; Suck foam, you big-bellied water weevils,&rdquo; howled Cockroach from the side
  of the boat.&nbsp; He was beginning to enjoy the moment.&nbsp; He laughed himself silly when the boat spun around at the shore
  and threw a wall of water into the crowd.&nbsp; The wake shook Old Yellow Fat&rsquo;s branch and sent him tumbling into the
  water.&nbsp; It was more than Cockroach could bear.&nbsp; He laughed so hard he thought his sides would split open like mayfly
  skin.&nbsp; Silverfish laughed and shrieked right along with him.&nbsp; Stinkbug was frightened out of her wits and was leaving
  vapor trails all over the pond.&nbsp; Book Louse was frantically calculating the velocity of the boat as a measure of its power
  output and estimating the resistance of the water against the strength of the hull.&nbsp; He was certain the boat would fly apart
  at any moment.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was quite a race indeed, and there certainly would never be another one like it again.&nbsp;
  However, not everyone in the crowd was pleased with the outcome.&nbsp; The bull ants, in particular, complained the boat had
  ruined the race and wanted all bets returned.&nbsp; But most of the spectators forgot about their bets and left the pond filled
  with amazement, thrilled to have witnessed such an incredible event.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">With the excitement over and while the shadows of suntime&rsquo;s end crept across the pond, the
  bug-fellows laid anchor along the shore.&nbsp; It would be their last suntime&rsquo;s end together.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Book Louse and Grand Daddy Long-Legs were the first to wake with the next suntime and they
  immediately started preparations for their departure.&nbsp; The little excursion across the pond had used an unexpected amount of
  battery power and Book Louse thought it wise to leave as soon as possible.&nbsp; Stinkbug pleaded with them to stay in
  Meadowfield.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t understand why they would want to go back to live in the Loomer home.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our home,&rdquo; explained Book Louse.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Right matey,&rdquo; replied Grand Daddy Long-Legs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not much... but we still
  call it home.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Besides, who&rsquo;ll look after the next group of wayfaring bug-fellows?&rsquo; quipped
  Book Louse.&nbsp; Then Book Louse turned and whispered something to Grand Daddy Long-Legs.&nbsp; The eight-legged creature
  scurried off and disappeared into the red block-like structure.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t long before he came back, all puffed up and
  proud.&nbsp; In an outstretched leg, he held a sparkling, dangly-thing.&nbsp; It was a golden color, thin as a leaf and tied to a
  yellow cord.&nbsp; Grand Daddy Long-Legs carefully placed the cord over Stinkbug&rsquo;s bowed head so the shining object could
  hang down from her neck.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of Grand Daddy Long-Legs&rsquo; old war metals,&rdquo; replied Book
  Louse.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided to present it to you, Ms. Pentatomidae.&nbsp; We feel you have more than earned
  it.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, soldier,&rdquo; said Grand Daddy Long-Legs.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become quite a
  war hero yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he stood back for a moment and saluted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wear it with pride,&rdquo; he
  said.&nbsp; Stinkbug saluted back, proudly.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;...and the meek shall inherit the earth,&rdquo; Book Louse quoted quietly to himself.&nbsp;
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe me? &nbsp;Look it up.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Grand Daddy Long-Legs hugged Stinkbug.&nbsp; It was quite a sight to see Grand Daddy Long-Legs,
  with his eight skinny legs, wrapped around Stinkbug in a good-bye embrace.&nbsp; Silverfish and Cockroach declined the hugs and
  shook a leg instead. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cockroach, Stinkbug and Silverfish stood along the shore as Grand Daddy Long-Legs started up the
  engine and the boat began to pull away.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; Everyone waved and waved as the boat sputtered on toward
  the far side of Meadow Pond.&nbsp; When it reached the middle of the pond, Book Louse suddenly hopped on the rail of the boat and
  began to solemnly recite.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3 c34">Long I&rsquo;ve been tossed like the driven foam; but now,
  proud world! I&rsquo;m going home</span><span class="c3">.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Emerson. &nbsp;Hey!&nbsp;
  Don&rsquo;t believe me? Look it up!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What is he yelling about?&rdquo; said Silverfish.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he
  saying?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; said Cockroach. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never understood anything that
  gnat said anyway. &nbsp;No sense trying to figure him out now.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">And so, there they were, just three bug-fellows alone on the shore.&nbsp; Stinkbug continued to
  wave, even after the boat was out of sight.&nbsp; Then he helped Cockroach and Silverfish</span> <span class=
  "c3">pile</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the cargo of tidbits and crystal cubes on top of some leaves they had strung together with
  blades of grass.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Quite a packing job I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; remarked Silverfish as he admired the
  arrangement of tidbits.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You had help,&rdquo; snapped Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose.&nbsp; Now help me haul it up to the forest.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Haul it all the way up to the forest... and right into your silvery cylinder.&nbsp;
  That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re thinking!&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you, Silverfish?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just pretend I didn&rsquo;t hear that, Cockroach.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The argument continued, all the way across the meadow and into the forest.&nbsp; It became really
  heated when they reached the silvery cylinder, or what was left of it.&nbsp; Silverfish saw her battered home and shrieked.&nbsp;
  She was not pleased.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;My silvery cylinder!&nbsp; Look at it!&nbsp; Just look at it!&nbsp; Cockroach!&nbsp; What
  have you done to it?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; said Cockroach.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Look at it!&rdquo; wailed Silverfish.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not even silvery
  anymore.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an ugly reddish brownish mess.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not smooth.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all pushed in!&nbsp;
  You were in there, weren&rsquo;t you Cockroach!&nbsp; The threads across the opening are gone.&nbsp; You did
  this!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh really,&rdquo; said Cockroach.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those thin, little threads wouldn&rsquo;t
  still be there after all this time.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh?&nbsp; So you seem to know a lot about these</span> <span class="c2">thin, little
  threads</span><span class="c4">, don&rsquo;t you Cockroach?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">And the bickering started.&nbsp; Brutal and bitter.&nbsp; Vile and venomous.&nbsp; Loud and
  lengthy.&nbsp; Stinkbug tried to calm the two angry bug-fellows, but it was no use.&nbsp; She gave up and climbed up on the mossy
  rock to wait them out.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was a good length of time before a further discovery was made.&nbsp; It was something that
  Stinkbug happened to spot, dangling from the battered opening of the silvery cylinder.&nbsp; In fact, the glowworms, who had
  arrived on the scene flashing and wiggling about in excitement, were the ones who managed to get Silverfish and Cockroach to stop
  fighting long enough to take notice of this discovery.&nbsp; It hung from a shred of Web Spinner thread, where it caught each
  gentle breeze and reflected the most beautiful array of colors with every glint of light that struck upon its surface.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug, being the tallest of the three, plucked it down from the top of the cylinder
  opening.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; grumbled Cockroach.&nbsp; &ldquo;Another one of your traps,
  Silverfish?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No, no, look,&rdquo; remarked Stinkbug.&nbsp; &ldquo;It looks like butterfly scales and
  bits of scarab shell.&nbsp; Look how they shine so beautifully together.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So how&rsquo;d they get up there?&rdquo; Silverfish asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Something must have
  hung them there, intentionally it seems.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And</span> <span class="c2">this</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I recognize,&rdquo; said
  Stinkbug pointing to one corner of the object.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Pressed onto a corner of the scales and scarab shell bits, was a circular dab of beeswax.&nbsp; In
  the middle of this dab of wax, was the imprint of what appeared to be a tarsal print, the footprint of a bee
  bug-fellow.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I know what this is!&rdquo; Stinkbug quietly shrieked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have seen this
  before.&nbsp; Scarab the Dung himself once showed me the same wax tarsal print. &nbsp;He had it saved among his favorite
  keepsakes.&nbsp; Do you know what this is?&nbsp; This is the seal of the Queen.&nbsp; The Queen Bee.&nbsp; Why Silverfish, I
  believe you have just been invited to the Grand Ball.&nbsp; This must be her invitation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stinkbug looked over to
  Silverfish with admiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Congratulations, Silverfish.&nbsp; You must feel quite special.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp; A special scoundrel,&rdquo; Cockroach groused. &nbsp;&ldquo;Give me that
  thing.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Now, now Cockroach,&rdquo; started Stinkbug as she pulled the invitation from
  Cockroach&rsquo;s reach.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is Silverfish&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She is going to the Great Cicada Emergence Ball and I
  presume all the festivities that go along with it.&nbsp; Very exciting!&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So what.&nbsp; A stupid Ball.&nbsp; Who cares.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go
  anyway.&nbsp; Have your old stinking invitation, Silverfish.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I will, Cockroach.&nbsp; And I will enjoy myself immensely,&rdquo; Silverfish chuckled.
  &ldquo;Especially since you&rsquo;re not going to be there,&rdquo; and she rolled over on her back in a peal of
  laughter.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Stinkbug had a slight grin on her face as she watched her two companions carry on.&nbsp; Cockroach
  was so upset that Silverfish would deserve an invitation to</span> <span class="c2">anything</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and
  Silverfish was prepared to rub it in as long as possible.&nbsp; Stinkbug let them behave badly for a while before she quietly
  said, &ldquo;There are three of these,&rdquo; she smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you hear me, you silly pests?&rdquo; &nbsp;Her voice
  became louder.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are three invitations.&nbsp; We are all going!&rdquo; &nbsp;Silverfish and Cockroach looked at
  one another with disbelief before Stinkbug suddenly lifted both of them in her arms and began dancing about with glee.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">The merriment continued, while high above in the trees, unnoticed, sat Worker 1200 quietly
  observing it all.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why the Queen insisted,&rdquo; she said to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Inviting
  Stinkbug carries a certain risk with her untimely stink fumes&hellip; but those other two?&nbsp; Just look at them.&nbsp; I know
  the Queen heard of their recent adventures.&nbsp; Why, I suppose all of Meadowfield knows about that by now. &nbsp;And yes, they
  probably do have a number of entertaining tales to tell. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">But,</span><span class=
  "c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">they are still&hellip;</span> <span class="c2">so undignified</span><span class=
  "c4">.&nbsp; Just look at how they&rsquo;re carrying on, right now!&nbsp; The Queen even wants them to have a major part in the
  entertainment.&nbsp; Story telling time, she will call it.&nbsp; I tried to warn her.&nbsp; I really didn&rsquo;t think it was a
  good idea.&nbsp; Something is going to go wrong.&nbsp; Something is definitely going to go wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worker 1200 took a very long, very deep sigh.&nbsp; She gathered up the remaining invitations and
  prepared to be on her way. &ldquo;Oh well.&nbsp; Back to the grind.&rdquo;&nbsp; As she took flight, Worker 1200 began muttering
  an endless list of chores.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just a few more invitations to deliver, but much more nectar to gather, hives to clean,
  honey to mix, wax to mold...&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she began repeating, over and over to herself, as she flew into the cloudy,
  graying sky,</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Something is going to go wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c15"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Something is</span> <span class="c2">definitely</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;going to go
  wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
